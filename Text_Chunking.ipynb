        "***Explanation:*** In this approach, text is split into chunks based on predefined rules. For instance, sentences might be separated using periods, question marks, or exclamation marks. These methods work well for languages with well-defined punctuation rules. However, they might struggle with informal or complex sentence structures.\n",

Machine learning algorithms may be used to identify natural divisions within the text. For instance, by understanding the relationships between words or phrases, these methods can group related information together. However, the effectiveness heavily relies on the quality of training data and the complexity of language nuances.\n",

The Covid-19 pandemic,  now in its third year, continues to spin off new variants. The  war in Ukraine reverberates throughout the world, causing  immense human suffering, including a cost-of-living crisis.  Climate and ecological disasters threaten the world daily.  It is seductively easy to discount crises as one-offs, natural  to hope for a return to normal. But dousing the latest fire or  booting the latest demagogue will be an unwinnable game  of whack-a-mole unless we come to grips with the fact that  the world is fundamentally changing. There is no going back.  Layers of uncertainty are stacking up and interacting to  unsettle our lives in unprecedented ways. People have faced  diseases, wars and environmental disruptions before. But the  confluence of destabilizing planetary pressures with grow - ing inequalities, sweeping societal transformations to ease  those pressures and widespread polarization present new,  complex, interacting sources of uncertainty for the world and  everyone in it. That is the new normal. Understanding and responding to  it are the goals of the 2021/2022 Human Development Re - port, Uncertain Times, Unsettled Lives: Shaping our Future in  a Transforming World . It caps a trilogy of Reports beginning  with the 2019 Report on inequalities, followed by the 2020  Report on the risks of the Anthropocene—where humans have  become a major force driving dangerous planetary change. Thirty-two years ago, the very first Human Development  Report declared boldly that “people are the real wealth of  nations.” That powerful refrain has guided UNDP and its Hu - man Development Reports ever since, with its messages and  meanings taking on richer hues over time.  People around the world are now telling us that they feel  ever more insecure. UNDP’s Special Report on Human Se - curity, launched earlier this year, found that six out of seven  people worldwide reported feeling insecure about many  aspects of their lives, even before the Covid-19 pandemic. Is it any wonder, then, that many nations are creaking  under the strain of polarization, political extremism and  demagoguery—all supercharged by social media, artificial  intelligence and other powerful technologies? Or that, in a stunning reversal from just a decade ago,  democratic backsliding among countries has become the  norm rather than the exception? Or that, in a stunning first, the global Human Development  Index value has declined for two years in a row in the wake  of the Covid-19 pandemic? People are the real wealth of nations, mediated through  our relationships with our governments, with our natural en - vironments, with each other. Each new crisis reminds us that  when people’s capabilities, choices and hopes for the future  feel dashed, the wellbeing of their nations and the planet are  the accompanying casualties. Now let us imagine the reverse: what our nations, our  planet, would look like if we expanded human development,  including people’s agency and freedoms. That would be a  world where our creativity is unleashed to reimagine our fu - tures, to renew and adapt our institutions, to craft new stories  about who we are and what we value. It would be not just a  nice-to-have; it would be a must-have when the world is in  ongoing, unpredictable flux.  We got a glimpse of what is possible in the Covid-19 pan - demic. A battery of new vaccines, including some based on  revolutionary technology, saved an estimated 20 million lives  in one year. Let that sink in, that extraordinary achievement  in the annals of humankind. Equally extraordinary is the num - ber of unnecessary lives lost, especially in low- and middle- income countries, from highly unequal vaccine access. The  pandemic has been a painful reminder of how breakdowns in  trust and in cooperation, among and within nations, foolishly  constrain what we can achieve together. The hero and the villain in today’s uncertainty story are  one in the same: human choice. It is far too glib to encour - age people to look for silver linings or to state that the glass  is half full rather than half empty, for not all choices are the  same. Some—arguably the ones most relevant to the fate of  our species—are propelled by institutional and cultural iner - tia, generations in the making.  This year’s Report invites us to take a hard look at ossi - fied and oversimplified assumptions about human decision - making. Institutions assume away people’s messiness—our  emotions, our biases, our sense of belonging—at our peril.  As with its predecessors, the Report also challenges  conventional notions of “progress,” where self-defeating  tradeoffs are being made. Gains in some areas, as in years of  schooling or life expectancy, do not compensate for losses  in others, as in people’s sense of control over their lives. Nor  can we enjoy material wealth at the expense of planetary  health. This Report firmly positions human development not just  as a goal but as a means to a path forward in uncertain times,  reminding us that people—in all our complexity, our diversity,  our creativity—are the real wealth of nations. Achim Steiner   Administrator   United Nations Development Programme FOREWORD iii HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 AcknowledgementsWe live in a world of worry: the ongoing  Covid-19 pandemic, continuing regional  and local conflicts, record-breaking  temperatures, fires and storms. Many  reports document these challenges and  initiatives and offer recommendations on  how to address them, but this year’s Hu - man Development Report is an invitation  to take a step back. Many challenges,  rather than being separate, may be trou - bling manifestation of an emerging, new  uncertainty complex that is unsettling  lives around the world. The 2019 Human  Development Report explored inequali - ties in human development, the 2020  Human Development Report focused  on how those inequalities drive and are  exacerbated by the dangerous planetary  change of the Anthropocene, and the  2022 Special Report on Human Security  examined the emergence of new forms  of insecurity. The 2021/2022 Human  Development Report unites and extends  these discussions under the theme of  uncertainty  — how it is changing, what it  means for human development and how  we can thrive in the face of it. The linger - ing effects of the pandemic made pre - paring the Report challenging, including  through delays in key data availability.  The Report was made possible because  of the encouragement, generosity and  contributions of so many, recognized  only imperfectly and partially in these  acknowledgments. The members of our Advisory Board,  led by Michèle Lamont and Tharman  Shanmugaratnam as co-chairs, sup - ported us in multiple and long virtual  meetings, providing extensive advice on  four versions of lengthy drafts. The other  members of the Advisory Board were  Olu Ajakaiye, Kaushik Basu, Diane Coyle,  Oeindrila Dube, Cai Fang, Marc Fleur - baey, Amadou Hott, Ravi Kanbur, Ha - rini Nagendra, Thomas Piketty, Belinda Reyers, Dan Smith, Qixiang Sun, Ilona  Szabó de Carvalho, Krushil Watene and  Helga Weisz. Complementing the advice from our  Advisory Board, the Report’s Statistical  Advisory Panel provided guidance on  several methodological and data aspects  of the Report  — in particular those related  to calculating the Report’s human devel - opment indices. We are grateful to all the  panel members: Mario Biggeri, Camilo  Ceita, Ludgarde Coppens, Koen Decan - cq, Marie Haldorson, Jason Hickel, Steve  Macfeely, Mohd Uzir Mahidin, Silvia  Montoya, Shantanu Mukherjee, Michaela  Saisana, Hany Torky and Dany Wazen. We are thankful for especially close  collaborations with our partners: the  CUNY Advanced Science Research Cen - ter, including Anthony D. Cak, Pamela  Green and Charles Vörösmarty; the part - nership between the German Institute  of Development and Sustainability & V- Dem Institute, University of Gothenburg,  including Francesco Burchi, Charlotte  Fiedler, Jean Lachapelle, Julia Leininger,  Staffan I. Lindberg, Svend-Erik Skan - ning and Armin Von Schiller; the Global  Policy Laboratory at the University of  California, Berkeley, including Solomon  Hsiang, Jonathan Proctor, Luke Sher - man and Jeanette Tseng; the Institute for  Economics and Peace, including Andrew  Etchell, David Hammond, Steven Killelea  and Paulo Pinto; the Peace Research  Institute Oslo, including Siri Aas Rustad,  Andrew Arasmith and Gudrun Østby; the  Stockholm International Peace Research  Institute, including Richard Black, Claire  McAllister and Jürg Staudenmann; the  Stockholm Resilience Centre, including  David Collste, Beatrice Crona, Victor  Galaz and Louise Hård af Segerstad;  and the World Inequality Lab, including  Lucas Chancel, Amory Gethin and Clara  Martinez-Toledano.Appreciation is also extended for all  the data, written inputs and peer reviews  of draft chapters to the Report, includ - ing those by Saleem H.

Their ongoing support is much appreci - ated and remains essential. We are grateful for the highly profes - sional work of our editors and layout  artists at Communications Development  Incorporated  — led by Bruce Ross-Larson  with Joe Caponio, Meta de Coquereau - mont, Mike Crumplar, Christopher Trott  and Elaine Wilson. Bruce, in particular,  has been a constant source of sound  advice, inspiration and, not infrequently,  motivation. As always, we are extremely grateful  to UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.  Facing the demands of leading an orga - nization during unprecedented times, he  always found time to give probing advice  and to provide encouragement. He has  consistently given the team the freedom  to explore and to venture beyond well- trodden paths. At a time when expanding  freedoms is essential to navigate uncer - tainties, we hope to have made good use  of that incredible trust and commitment  to the editorial independence of every  Human Development Report.

The ongoing Covid-19  pandemic, which has driven reversals in human de - velopment in almost every country and continues to  spin off variants unpredictably. War in Ukraine and  elsewhere, more human suffering amid a shifting  geopolitical order and strained multilateral system.  Record-  breaking temperatures, fires and storms, each  an alarm bell from planetary systems increasingly out  of whack. Acute crises are giving way to chronic, lay - ered, interacting uncertainties at a global scale, paint - ing a picture of uncertain times and unsettled lives. Uncertainty is not new. Humans have long worried  about plagues and pestilence, violence and war, floods  and droughts. Some societies have been brought to  their knees by them. At least as many have embraced  emerging, unsettling realities and found clever ways  to thrive. There are no inevitabilities, just tough un - knowns whose best answer is a doubling down on  human development to unleash the creative and co - operative capacities that are so essentially human. Novel layers of uncertainties are interacting to create  new kinds of uncertainty  — a new uncertainty complex   — never seen in human history (figure 1). In addition to  the everyday uncertainty that people have faced since time immemorial, we are now navigating uncharted  waters, caught in three volatile crosscurrents: • The dangerous planetary change of the  Anthropocene.1 • The pursuit of sweeping societal transformations  on par with the Industrial Revolution. • The vagaries and vacillations of polarized societies. Navigating this new uncertainty complex is ham - pered by persistent deprivations and inequalities in  human development. The past decade finally placed  inequality under a spotlight, but less illuminated  were the ways that inequalities and uncertainty con - tribute to insecurity and vice versa. The variation in  opportunity and outcome among and within nations  is mirrored by  — and interacts with  — the volatility  that people experience in their lives. Complicating  matters is a geopolitical order in flux, hamstring - ing a multilateral system designed for postwar, not  postmillennium, challenges and creaking under the  weight of naked national interests. The Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine  are devastating manifestations of today’s uncer - tainty complex. Each exposes limits of  — and cracks  in — current global governance. Each has battered  Figure 1 A new uncertainty complex is emerging New kinds of uncertainty now  layer and interact forming a  new uncertainty complex The pursuit of sweeping societal transformations Widespread, intensifying polarization Dangerous planetary change of the AnthropoceneEveryday uncertainty that people have always faced Source: Human Development Report Office. OVERVIEW 3 global supply chains, driving up price volatility in en - ergy, food, fertilizers, commodities and other goods.  But it is their interaction that, at the time of this writ - ing, is transforming shocks into an impending global  catastrophe. UN Secretary-General António Guterres  has repeatedly warned of a prolonged global food cri - sis due to the confluence of war, pandemic and warm - ing temperatures.2 Billions of people face the greatest  cost-of-living crisis in a generation.3 Billions already  grapple with food insecurity,4 owing largely to inequal - ities in wealth and power that determine entitlements  to food. A global food crisis will hit them hardest. Global crises have piled up: the global financial  crisis, the ongoing global climate crisis and Covid- 19 pandemic, a looming global food crisis. There is a  nagging sense that whatever control we have over our  lives is slipping away, that the norms and institutions  we used to rely on for stability and prosperity are not  up to the task of today’s uncertainty complex. Feel - ings of insecurity are on the rise nearly everywhere, a  trend that is at least a decade in the making and that  well precedes the Covid-19 pandemic and the atten - dant tailspin in global human development (figure 2).Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than  6 in 7 people at the global level felt insecure.5 This  against a backdrop of incredible global progress (not - withstanding the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic)  over the longer run on conventional measures of well - being, including on many of the human development  metrics tracked by the Human Development Report.  What is going on? How does the wide-angle lens of  human development help us understand and respond  to this apparent paradox of progress with insecurity?  Such questions animate this year’s Report (box 1). One of the frustrating ironies of the Anthropocene  is that while we have more power to influence our  future, we do not necessarily have any more control  over it. From the climate crisis to far-reaching tech - nological changes, other important forces  — many of  our own making — are expanding the set of possible  outcomes, some unknowable, of any given action.  For many, getting from point A to point B in their lives  and in their communities feels unclear, unsure, hard   — harder still when persistent inequalities, polariza - tion and demagoguery make it difficult to agree on  what point B even is and to get moving.

Policies that  focus on the Three I’s  — investment, insurance and  innovation  — will go a long way in helping people nav - igate the new uncertainty complex and thrive in the  face of it (see chapter 6). • Investment, ranging from renewable energy to  preparedness for pandemics and extreme natural  hazards, will ease planetary pressures and pre - pare societies to better cope with global shocks.  Consider the advances in seismology, tsunami  sciences and disaster risk reduction following the  2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.6 Smart, practical in - vestments pay off. • Insurance does too. It helps protect everyone from  the contingencies of an uncertain world. The  global surge in social protection in the wake of  the Covid-19 pandemic did just that, while under - scoring how little social insurance coverage there  was before and how much more remains to be  done. Investments in universal basic services such  as health and education also afford an insurance  function. • Innovation in its many forms  — technological,  economic, cultural  — will be vital in responding to unknown and unknowable challenges that human - ity will face. While innovation is a whole-of-society  affair, government is crucial in this regard: not just  in creating the right policy incentives for inclusive  innovation but also in being an active partner  throughout. Deeper still are the assumptions underpinning in - stitutions that develop and implement policy at all  levels. Assumptions about how people make deci - sions are often oversimplified. The dominance of  these assumptions has occasioned a narrower set of  policy options than what is needed to navigate the  new uncertainty complex (see chapter 3). Widen - ing the set of policy options starts with recognizing  the many cognitive biases and inconsistencies we all  have in our decisionmaking. Moreover, what we de - cide is often rooted in what we value. What we value  is in turn rooted in our social context. It is contextual,  malleable. Scrutinizing unhelpful social inertias and  experimenting with new narratives must be part of  the toolbox going forward (see chapter 3). So must technology. True, technology is more dou - ble-edged sword than silver bullet. Fossil-fuel com - bustion technologies are warming the planet while  nuclear fusion promises to bottle the sun, ushering  in a new era of limitless, clean energy. With every in - ternet search, retweet and like, our digital footprints  generate more data than ever, but we struggle to use  it for the common good, and some deliberately mis - use it. In a voracious scramble for more of our data,  technology giants are concentrating in their hands  more and more power over everyone’s lives. The trick  for us is to bend technology purposefully towards in - clusive, creative solutions to challenges old and new  rather than allowing it to function like a bull in a china  shop, breaking things just because. We need technol - ogies that augment labour rather than displace it, that  disrupt selectively rather than indiscriminately (see  chapter 4). As we drift further into this new uncertainty com - plex, unknown challenges loom  — more tough ques - tions without easy answers, more self-defeating  opportunities to retreat within borders that are as po - rous to climate and technology as they have been to  Covid-19. If the pandemic is seen as a test run of how  we navigate our shared, global future, then we need  to learn from it, from the good and the bad, to figure  out how to do better. Much better.Box 1 The 2021/2022 Human Development Report extends  the conversations of earlier Reports How to understand and navigate today’s uncertainty  complex — driven by the Anthropocene, by purposeful so - cietal transformation and by intensifying polarization — is  the topic of this year’s Human Development Report. Much  attention over the past decade has been rightly paid to in - equalities. Indeed, inequalities and their emerging dimen - sions were the focus of the 2019 Human Development  Report,1 carried forward into the following year’s Report  on the socioecological pressures of the Anthropocene.2  The variations in opportunity and outcome among and  within nations also happen within people’s lives, giving  rise to more and new forms of insecurity, which were ex - plored in the United Nations Development Programme’s  Special Report on Human Security earlier this year.3 The  2021/2022 Human Development Report unites and ex - tends these discussions under the theme of uncertainty —  how it is changing, what it means for human development  and how we can thrive in the face of it.

OVERVIEW 5 The Covid-19 pandemic is a  window into a new reality Now in its third year, the Covid-19 pandemic has ex - acted a terrible toll in lives and livelihoods around the  world. It is more than a long detour from normal; it  is a window into a new reality, a painful glimpse into  deep, emblematic contradictions, exposing a conflu - ence of fragilities. On the one hand, an impressive feat of modern  science: the development of safe, effective vaccines  to a novel virus in less than a year. Having saved  tens, perhaps hundreds, of millions of lives over  the past century, especially of children, vaccines re - main one of humanity’s greatest, most cost-effective technological innovations  — ever.7 The battery of  Covid-19 vaccines is no exception. In 2021 alone  Covid-19 vaccination programmes averted nearly  20 million deaths.8 It is a lesson of the power of tech - nology to transform lives for the better at a time when  we hear so much about the ways technology can do  just the opposite. But access to Covid-19 vaccines remains appalling - ly low or virtually nonexistent in many low-income  countries (figure 3), especially in Africa, which have  endured age-specific infection fatality rates twice  those of high-income countries.9 Reaching rural  areas with weaker cold chains and fewer healthcare  workers remains difficult. Meanwhile, vaccine uptake  in many richer countries has stalled, due partly to  Figure 3 Countries’ access to Covid-19 vaccines remains highly inequal High income countries 3 in 4 people or 72%  have been vaccinated with at least one dose as of July 27, 2022 Low income countries 1 in 5 people or 21%  have been vaccinated with at least one dose as of July 27, 2022 Source: Global Dashboard for Vaccine Equity ( https://data.undp.org/vaccine-equity/ ), accessed 27 July 2022. 6 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 perplexing disputes about vaccines generally.10 The  last mile is long in every country. Unequal, unjust access to Covid-19 vaccines is  one of many inequalities that have weighed heavily  throughout the pandemic. Indeed, those inequalities  have helped fuel its spread. The groups most likely to  be left behind have borne the brunt of its health and  economic risks. Women and girls have shouldered  even more household and caregiving responsibili - ties, while violence against them has worsened (see  chapter 2).11 Pre-existing digital divides have wid - ened gaps in children’s education access and quality.12  Some fear a “lost generation” of learners.13 For people everywhere the Covid-19 pandemic  has generated questions without easy answers, fore - most among them: When is this “over”? Answers  have proved fleeting, often dashed by upticks in cases  or the setting of new restrictions, forcing us back to  square one. Global supply chains remain stubborn - ly knotted, contributing to inflation in all countries   — and in some, at rates not seen in decades.14 The  implications of unprecedented monetary and fiscal  interventions aiming to rescue ravaged economies,  many still scarred by the global financial crisis, re - main largely uncertain. They unspool before us in  real time and alongside resurgent geopolitical ten - sions. The pandemic is more than a virus, and it sim - ply is not “over.” With successive waves that have caught countries  flat-footed time and time again, ongoing mutability  and the seesawing of lockdowns, the Covid-19 pan - demic and its seemingly endless twists and turns  have  — perhaps above all else  — entrenched a climate  of dogged uncertainty and unsettledness. And this  is just one pandemic, having emerged seemingly out  of nowhere, like a phantom that cannot be exorcised.  We were long warned about the threat of novel res - piratory pathogens.15 As we move deeper into the An - thropocene, we have been warned that there will be  more. A new uncertainty complex is emerging The impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on economies  pale beside the upheavals expected by powerful new  technologies and the hazards and transformations  they pose. What do investments in people’s education  and skills  — a key part of human development — look like in the face of the disorienting pace of techno - logical change, including automation and artificial  intelligence? Or in the face of deliberate, necessary  energy transitions that would restructure societies?  More broadly, amid unprecedented patterns of dan - gerous planetary change, what capabilities matter  and how? “ The impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic  on economies pale beside the upheavals  expected by powerful new technologies and  the hazards and transformations they pose Recent years have seen more record temperatures,  fires and storms around the world, alarming remind - ers that the climate crisis marches on, alongside other  planetary-level changes wrought by the Anthropo - cene. Biodiversity collapse is one of them. More  than 1 million plant and animal species face extinc - tion.16 As much as the Covid-19 pandemic caught us  by surprise, unprepared and fumbling for paths for - ward, we have even less of an idea of how to live in a  world without, say, an abundance of insects. That has  not been tried for about 500 million years, when the  world’s first land plants appeared. This is not a coin - cidence. Without an abundance of insect pollinators,  we face the mindboggling challenge of growing food  and other agricultural products at scale. Human societies and ecological systems have long  influenced  — and surprised  — one another, but not  at the scales and speeds of the Anthropocene. Hu - mans are now shaping planetary trajectories,17 and  the dramatically changing baselines  — from global  temperatures to species diversity  — are altering the  fundamental frame of reference humans have been  operating under for millennia. It is as if the ground  beneath our feet is shifting, introducing a new kind of  planetary uncertainty for which we have no real guide. Material cycles, for example, have been upended.  For the first time in history, humanmade materials,  such as concrete and asphalt, outweigh the Earth’s  biomass. Microplastics are now everywhere: in coun - try-sized garbage patches in the ocean, in protect - ed forests and distant mountaintops and in people’s  lungs and blood.18 Mass coral bleaching is now com - monplace rather than extraordinary.19 The latest International Panel on Climate Change  Report is a “code red for humanity.”20 While we still  OVERVIEW 7 have the possibility to prevent excessive global warm - ing and avoid the worst scenarios, human-induced  changes to our planetary system are expected to con - tinue well into the future. In essence, as science has  advanced, the models are, with better precision than  before, predicting more volatility.21 Any one of the rapid, planetary-level, human-in - duced changes of the Anthropocene would be enough  on its own to inject frightening new uncertainties into  the fate of not just individuals, communities or even  nations, but of all humankind. Recall just a few dec - ades ago when chlorofluorocarbons entered global  consciousness. Or the insecticide known as DDT be - fore that. Or nuclear proliferation before that (and,  sadly, still today). The human-induced forces at work  in the Anthropocene are not atomized or neatly se - quenced. They are not islands of perturbations in a  sea of relative stability. Instead, they are stacked on  top of each other, interacting and amplifying in un - predictable ways. For the first time in human history,  anthropogenic existential threats loom larger than  those from natural hazards.22 “ The layering and interactions of  multidimensional risks and the overlapping  of threats give rise to new dimensions of  uncertainty, if for no other reason than human  choices have impacts well beyond our weakened  socioecological systems’ capacities to absorb them For this reason, in its portraiture of uncertainty, the  Report does not build scenarios. Instead, it explores  how three novel sources of uncertainty at the global  level stack up to create a new uncertainty complex  that is unsettling lives and dragging on human devel - opment (see chapter 1): • The first novel uncertainty is associated with the  Anthropocene’s dangerous planetary change and  its interaction with human inequalities. • The second is the purposeful if uncertain transition  towards new ways of organizing industrial societies  — purporting transformations similar to those in the  transition from agricultural to industrial societies.23 • The third is the intensification of political and so - cial polarization across and within countries  — and  of misperceptions both about information and  across groups of people  — facilitated by how new  digital technologies are often being used.24The layering and interactions of multidimensional  risks and the overlapping of threats give rise to new  dimensions of uncertainty, if for no other reason than  human choices have impacts well beyond our weak - ened socioecological systems’ capacities to absorb  them. In this new uncertainty complex shocks can  amplify and interact rather than dissipate; they can  be propagated in systems rather than stabilized by  them. Human pulsing of natural systems at unprecedent - ed intensities and scales is one side of the uncertainty  coin. On the other are stubborn social deficits, in - cluding deficits in human development, which make  it more difficult to navigate unpredictable outcomes  and to dial down those pulses in the first place. Con - sider the Covid-19 pandemic, which has as much to  do with inequalities, poor leadership and distrust as  it does with variants and vaccines. Or competition  for environmental resources, competition that does  not typically break down into conflict. While stressed  ecosystems can parallel grievances, grievances be - come conflicts due to social imbalances.25 Political  power, inequalities and marginalization contribute  more to environmental conflict than does access to  natural resources. Political polarization complicates matters further  (figure 4). It has been on the rise, and uncertainty  makes it worse and is worsened by it (see chapter 4).  Large numbers of people feel frustrated by and alien - ated from their political systems.26 In a reversal from  just 10 years ago, democratic backsliding is now the  prevailing trend across countries.27 This despite high  support globally for democracy. Armed conflicts are  also up, including outside so-called fragile contexts.28  For the first time ever, more than 100 million people  are forcibly displaced, most of them within their own  countries.29 The conjunction of uncertainty and polarization  may be paralyzing — delaying action to curb human  pressures on the planet. The real paradox of our time  may be our inability to act, despite mounting evi - dence of the distress that human planetary pressures  are causing ecological and social systems. Unless we  get a handle on the worrying state of human affairs,  we face the Anthropocene’s vicissitudes with one  hand tied behind our backs. Even when functioning properly, conventional  crisis response and risk management mechanisms,  8 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 such as various forms of insurance, are not up to the  task of global, interconnected disruption. The unco - ordinated responses to the Covid-19 pandemic are  a case in point. New strategies are needed for tail  events synchronized at the global level. Addressing  risk through diversification is difficult when volatili - ty affects the entire system rather than only parts of  it. Yet, numerous countries around the world have  been steadily chipping away at risk sharing in many  ways.30 New forms of work and their uncertainties  have become more important in technology-enabled  gig economies. Altogether, insecurity has long been  on the rise. And it has been on the rise for some groups more  than others. Against a backdrop of novel, interacting  uncertainties, people with power, wealth or privilege  have the means, to some degree, to protect them - selves privately and to shift more of the burden on to  others. The groups most likely to be left behind face a world with complex new uncertainties in which most  of those uncertainties are directed at them, heaped  on persistent discrimination and human rights viola - tions.31 It is not just that typhoons are getting bigger  and deadlier through human impact on the environ - ment; it is also as if, through our social choices, their  destructive paths are being directed at the most vul - nerable among us. Feelings of distress are on the rise nearly everywhere An analysis of more than 14 million books published  over the last 125 years in three major languages shows  a sharp increase in expressions of anxiety and worry  in many parts of the world (figure 5).32 Other research  on smaller time scales reports steady increases in  concerns about uncertainty since 2012, well before  the Covid-19 outbreak.33Figure 4 Political polarization is on the rise across the world 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 Political p olarization in 2011Political p olarization in 2021 Eastern Europe and Central Asia Latin America and the Caribbean Middle East and North Africa Sub-Saharan Africa Western Europe and North America Asia and the PaciﬁcBeing placed above the line  means that polarization  increased from 2011 to 2021 Source: Adapted from Boese and others (2022). OVERVIEW 9 Earlier this year, the United Nations Development  Programme’s Special Report on Human Security  found similarly troubling levels of perceived insecu - rity. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than  6 in 7 people at the global level felt insecure.34 Per - ceived human insecurity is high across all Human De - velopment Index (HDI) groups, and it has increased,  even in some very high HDI countries (figure 6). Po - larization has moved in tandem in recent years. In  parallel, there is a breakdown of trust: globally, fewer  than 30 percent of people think that most people can  be trusted, the lowest value on record (see chapter 4). These and other data paint a puzzling picture in  which people’s perceptions about their lives and their  societies stand in stark contrast to historically high  measures of aggregate wellbeing, including long - standing multidimensional measures of wellbeing,  such as the HDI and other indices that accompany  this Report. In sum, twin paradoxes: progress with in - security and progress with polarization. What is going on? Too often the answer is reduced to fault-finding in - quiries about whether the data or the people are wrong.  Most likely, neither. Although people tend to express a  holistic view of their lived experience, the questions asked about their lives often focus on specific, measur - able subsets of that experience: years of schooling, life  expectancy, income. However important these metrics  are — and they are  — they do not capture the totality of  a lived experience. Nor were they ever intended to re - flect the full concept of human development, which  goes well beyond achievements in wellbeing, such as  reducing poverty or hunger, to include equally impor - tant notions of freedoms and agency, which together  expand the sense of possibility in people’s lives. Nor do  individual achievements necessarily capture social co - hesion and trust, which matter to people in their own  right and for working together towards shared goals. In  short, the twin paradoxes invite a hard look at narrow  conceptions of “progress.” The 2019 Human Development Report empha - sized going beyond averages to understand the wide  and growing variation in capabilities within many  countries. It identified widening gaps in enhanced  capabilities, such as access to higher education and  life expectancy at age 70, gaps that might also help  explain the apparent disconnect between what peo - ple say about their lives and what we measure about  them. These are not either-or explanations; all are  possible, even probable.35Figure 5 Negative views about the world surges to unprecedented highs English, United States  (90% conﬁdence interval) Spanish (95% conﬁdence interval) German (95% conﬁdence interval) Null-model (95% conﬁdence interval) 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 20202.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 –0.5z-score World War IWall Street crashWorld War IIGreat Recession Note: Negative views are defined as textual analogues of cognitive distortions in one- to five-word sequences reflecting depression, anxiety and other dis - tortions, published in 14 million books in English, Spanish and German over the past 125 years.

Achieving  gains may become harder, securing them harder still.  Backsliding may become more sudden or common or  both; it has already become evident during the Covid- 19 pandemic. For the first time on record, the glob - al HDI value declined, taking the world back to the  time just after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for  Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement.  Every year a few different countries experience dips in  their respective HDI values. But a whopping 90 per- cent of countries saw their HDI value drop in either  2020 or 2021 (figure 7), far exceeding the number that  experienced reversals in the wake of the global finan - cial crisis. Last year saw some recovery at the global  level, but it was partial and uneven: most very high  HDI countries notched improvements, while most of  the rest experienced ongoing declines (figure 8). The goal of human development is to help people  lead lives they value by expanding their capabilities,  which go beyond wellbeing achievements to include agency and freedoms. If uncertainty forms storm  clouds over all aspects of human development, then it  hurls lightning bolts at the idea of agency. It can disem - power. Choices mediate the translation of one’s values  and commitments into achievements, but the idea of  choice becomes ever more abstract, no matter how for - mally educated or healthy we may be, if we doubt that  the choices we make will yield the outcomes we desire.  Losing perceived control rather than simply not having  it in the first place has its own negative consequences,  as do the knock-on effects: a tendency to identify cul - prits or villains, a distrust of institutions and elites, and  greater insularity, nationalism and social discord. Un - certainty can turn up the heat on a toxic brew. Technology use is a double-edged sword Powerful new technologies turn it up further. From  the news, products and advertisements served up  to us to the relationships we build online and in real  life, more and more of our lives are being determined Figure 6 Perceived human insecurity is increasing in most countries — even in some very high Human  Development Index countries 0.400 1.000 0.600 0.800 Human Development Index (HDI) value, 2021Increase in  perceived insecurity Reduction in  perceived insecurityVery high HDI countriesHigh HDI countriesMedium HDI countriesLow HDI countries0.15 0.10 0.05 0 –0.05 –0.10Change in Index of Perceived Human Insecurity valuea Note: Bubble size represents the country population. a.

OVERVIEW 11 by algorithms and, in particular, by artificial intel - ligence. For people who are online, every aspect of  their lives becomes commodifiable data, raising wor - rying questions about who has access to what infor - mation, especially sensitive personal information,  and how it is being used.36 The political, commercial and personal all get mixed  together in social media, which is full of loud echo  chambers because they draw eyeballs, which draws advertising and other revenues. At least half the on - line noise is from bots designed to stir the pot.37 Mis - information moves faster and farther than information  that has been subjected to reasoned scrutiny, sowing  distrust and fanning perhaps the gravest kind of un - certainty: not knowing how to distinguish between  the two.

Polarization can take  dangerous forms when different groups operate with  entirely different sets of facts and, thus, realities, es - pecially when those realities are bound up with group  identities. Technologies then turn mere disagreements  into pitched battles for survival (see chapter 4). Given the ways technology use can aggravate at  the societal level, its harmful effects at the commu - nity and individual levels may come as no surprise.  As it is in so many parts of our lives, technology is a  double-edged sword. Artificial intelligence will both  create and destroy tasks, causing tremendous disrup - tion. Synthetic biology opens new frontiers in health  and medicine while raising fundamental questions  about what it means to be human. From the invention  of writing to Gutenberg’s printing press to Marco - ni’s first radio transmissions, technologies have been  connecting people ever faster in new ways, now in - stantaneously and across great distances. Today, tele - medicine is especially valuable in digitally connected  rural areas and has been vital for mental and physical  health during the pandemic.38 At the same time, rather paradoxically, technology  can isolate. Internet use has been found to reduce of - fline interaction, political participation and various  forms of civic and cultural engagement.39 The con - sequences of substituting the digital for the real are  complex and will be made more so as virtual worlds   — the metaverse  — take up more real estate. Cyberbul - lying is an issue on social media, and angry Twitter  mobs, mobilized sometimes by disinformation, can  digitally tar and feather someone faster than in real  life. Sometimes that spills over into real-life violence  or into real-life policy. Digital addiction is a real con - cern. Random rewards in the form of likes on Insta - gram or TikTok or the adrenaline rush of clickbait  are essentially cognitive hacks that lie at the heart of  most real-life casinos (see chapter 2).40 Mental wellbeing is under assault Mental wellbeing is an important, complex issue  globally without any single driver, technological or  otherwise. Mental distress, whose prevention is a critical aspect of overall mental wellbeing, is aggra - vated by uncertainties and insecurities of all stripes:  by major Anthropocene phenomena, such as climate  change; by age-old scourges of discrimination, exclu - sion, conflict and violence; and by relatively newer  entrants, such as social media and other technologies. The uncertainties of the Anthropocene are expect - ed to undermine people’s mental wellbeing through  four main pathways: traumatizing events, physical  illness, general climate anxiety and food insecurity  (see chapter 2). The effects these and other pathways  have on children in particular are profound, altering  brain and body development, especially in families  on lower social rungs, potentially diminishing what  children can achieve in life. The 2019 Human Devel - opment Report explored how inequalities in human  development are perpetuated across generations;41  it is not difficult to see how the confluence of mental  distress, inequality and insecurity foment a similarly  injurious intergenerational cycle that drags on human  development. “ The uncertainties of the Anthropocene  are expected to undermine people’s mental  wellbeing through four main pathways:  traumatizing events, physical illness, general  climate anxiety and food insecurity Violence  — even the threat of violence, its  uncertainty  — is a major driver of mental distress.  Some survivors of and witnesses to violence suffer  trauma, which if not addressed properly can devel - op into post-traumatic stress disorder, among other  chronic health conditions, that can weigh heavily on  the choices available to them. Violence may be di - rected at one person or group of people, but it affects  everybody in its blast radius. Even perpetrators of  violence can suffer trauma due to the violent setting  that often surrounds them, as with organized crime  or gang violence.42 The losses exacted by violence extend well beyond  direct physical, mental and emotional injury or trau - ma. Violence can cause and exacerbate all kinds of  insecurities  — food, economic and so forth  — that are  themselves major drivers of mental distress. Many  kinds of violence, from interpersonal violence to or - ganized crime to armed conflict, perniciously under - mine trust in people we know and in people we do not  OVERVIEW 13 know. Breakdowns in trust may then beget more in - stability, more violence. “ Mental disorders weigh on human development  in many ways. A health issue themselves, they are  often linked to other health challenges. They can  impede school attendance and learning, as well  as the ability to find a job and be fully productive  at it. The stigma that often accompanies  mental disorders makes matters worse Then there is the loss of agency due to violence. The  complex interplay of forces, rooted in asymmetries of  power, is powerfully at work in intimate partner vi - olence, whose survivors are predominately women  and which is correlated with some measures of wom - en’s economic dependence (see chapter 2). Channels  of dominance at the societal and institutional levels  can take concentrated, wicked forms  — especially for  women, children and older people  — behind what are  meant to be the safe walls of a home, leaving those  subjected to domestic abuse with either the percep - tion or the reality of no escape. The ensuing entrap - ment of people violates human rights, constrains  agency and ultimately undercuts our collective ability  to navigate a turbulent new era. As it has been in so many ways, the Covid-19 pan - demic is ominously illustrative. During the first year  of the pandemic, the global prevalence of depres - sion and anxiety increased by more than 25 percent.43  Low-income people, especially those who struggle  to afford basic needs such as rent and food, suffered  disproportionally in several countries.44 Women, who  assumed most of the additional domestic and care  work that emerged during school closures and lock - downs,45 faced much higher mental distress than be - fore the crisis.46 Stressors need not reach the level of globalized  trauma to cause mental distress. In fact, one of the  most serious economic threats to mental wellbeing  seems to stem from repeated financial shocks, such  as income loss, especially for poor people and for  men.47 Economic insecurity  — or just the perception  of such insecurity, even if transitory  — is a major fac - tor. Mental distress is one reason why economic dis - locations, whether from globalization or automation  or phasing out fossil fuels, carry some large, underap - preciated risks.Mental disorders, such as post-traumatic stress  disorder and depression, can develop when men - tal distress is severe and untreated. Almost 1  billion  people  — roughly one in eight of us  — live with a men - tal disorder,48 providing a lower-bound estimate of  the broader problem of mental distress. Globally,  mental health issues are the leading cause of disabil - ity. Yet, of those who need mental health attention  or treatment, only about 10 percent receive it.49 On  average, countries spend less than 2 percent of their  healthcare budgets on mental health.50 Mental disorders weigh on human development in  many ways. A health issue themselves, they are often  linked to other health challenges. They can impede  school attendance and learning, as well as the abili - ty to find a job and be fully productive at it. The stig - ma that often accompanies mental disorders makes  matters worse. Mental disorders are uniquely chal - lenging because the primary instrument to navigate  life’s challenges  — the mind  — is precisely the thing  that people living with a mental disorder may not be  able to rely on. The other thing we tend to rely on is  relationships. If those also suffer, people are left even  more isolated and vulnerable. Purposeful transformations introduce  their own uncertainties Today’s new uncertainty complex is not just about the  planetary pressures of the Anthropocene and politi - cal and social polarization; it is also about purposeful  societal transformations that seek to ease planetary  pressures and leverage the positive potential of new  technologies (see chapter 1). From energy systems to  food production to transportation, easing planetary  pressures demands fundamental changes to much  of the way the world currently operates. It is a nec - essary, wildly worthwhile investment — ethically, en - vironmentally, economically  — but it comes with its  own significant uncertainties, especially for econo - mies, livelihoods and pocketbooks.51 The energy transitions required to confront the cli - mate crisis would be challenging even in the best of  times. They become more so when stacked on top of  inequalities and social fragmentation, the rapid clip  of technological disruption and dangerous planetary  change. The backlash in some countries to various  14 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 forms of energy taxation or carbon pricing is a case  in point. However welcome new renewable energy  technologies may be at competitive market prices,  they carry their own environmental costs and risks,  including those related to mining to supply the mate - rials for the world’s solar panels and wind turbines.52 People rightly worry about winners and losers  when big change is on the horizon. Yes, the green  economy could add more than 24 million jobs world - wide by 2030.53 This is an exciting opportunity for  people and planet. But these jobs will not necessarily  be in the same regions that stand to lose jobs as fos - sil fuel industries shut down. Nor will they require the  same skills as a fossil fuel–based economy. No one  seems especially interested in a bigger overall pie if  his or her piece is feared to be getting much smaller. Nor do people need forecasts or history books to  know that societal transformations  — however well  planned or not, however “good” or not — can radical - ly reshape the communities they live in, often in un - expected ways where “do-overs” are not possible if  things go wrong. Many around the world have lived  through transformations, some ongoing, in their life - times. They see them with their own eyes. The trans - formations in energy and materials required now in  the Anthropocene portend even more upheavals,  which some believe to be as large as the shift from ag - ricultural to industrial societies.54 Whether it is the advent of agriculture or the In - dustrial Revolution, previous tectonic shifts have  typically stretched across multiple generations. Now,  they can happen within a generation, in a matter of  years, introducing a new kind of uncertainty or worry.  Whether through foresight or experience, that will  influence how people think about and invest in their  lives, families and communities and hold their lead - ers accountable. These are not reasons to give up on  a green economy; we cannot afford to throw in the  towel. But if we do not understand people’s pres - ent and future anxieties and address the underlying  drivers, if we do not build trust and the promise of a  better future, progress towards purposeful, just, sus - tainable transformations is going to be even harder. The net result of today’s uncertainty complex on  development is profound. We might be facing a grow - ing mismatch between what is needed to navigate  novel, interacting uncertainties and the current state  of affairs, categorized by social arrangements (what to do — in terms of policies, institutions) and the behav - iours shaped by social context, culture and narratives  (how to do it — in terms of prevalent identities, values  and beliefs). The interplay of forces  — their scales,  speeds, unknown interactions and consequences  —  have made development pathways simultaneously  far less obvious and far more open. What should hap - pen next can no longer be taken for granted. A line - ar march of progress in which low-income countries  chase higher income ones is less relevant. In a sense  all countries are developing countries, charting a new  planetary course together, regardless of whether they  work together to do so. “ In a sense all countries are developing countries,  charting a new planetary course together,  regardless of whether they work together to do so The question is no longer simply how some coun - tries get from point A to point B; instead, it is how  all countries start moving from wherever they are to  points N, T or W  — or letters in some new alphabet —  and then course correct along the way. Development  is perhaps better seen as a process characterized both  by adapting to an unfolding unknown reality and by  purposefully transforming economies and societies  to ease planetary pressures and advance inclusion.55 There is promise and opportunity in uncertainty If necessity is the mother of invention, then the very  forces that give rise to today’s uncertainties also offer  the means to navigate them. Uncertainty engenders  the possibility of change, also for the better. Consid - er artificial intelligence, a disruptive opportunity at  least as much as a disruptive threat. Its potential for  enhancing labour is bigger than its potential for au - tomating it. New tasks, new jobs, new industries are  all possible (figure 9). Recall that most jobs came  into being in part through the task-creating effects of  new technologies: around 60 percent of people in the  United States are now employed in occupations that  did not exist in 1940.56 We do not, however, have the  luxury to wait around for the long run. The negative  displacement impacts of artificial intelligence are too  big, too likely and too fast, especially if labour-replac - ing incentives dominate its development. Policies  OVERVIEW 15 and institutions must be put into place that nudge ar - tificial intelligence towards people rather than away  from them, to unlock and frontload its potential for  positive transformation. We are already witnessing artificial intelligence’s  upside in many areas (see chapter 5). Among its many  climate-related applications, it aids in modelling cli - mate change impacts and in predicting disasters. In  education it can facilitate individualized learning and  enhance accessibility. In biology it has revolutionized  protein folding prediction, a huge boon for medicine.57 Among the many things the Covid-19 pandemic  broke open was our imaginations. It expanded the  reference points for what is possible (see chapter 5).  Consider the rapid development and distribution in  many (but not all) countries of safe, effective Covid- 19 vaccines, some based on new mRNA technologies  that hold promise for preventing and treating many  other diseases. The pandemic normalized paid sick  leave, voluntary social distancing and self-isolation,  all important for our response to future pandemics. The interventions by central banks over the past  two years dwarf their interventions in the wake of  the global financial crisis about a decade earlier. Fis - cal policy saw a sea change, too. Social protection has surged, protecting many people from even  worse impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic while pro - viding large-scale test cases of innovative ideas:  linking national registries and databases for eligibil - ity determination; expanding coverage to previously  uncovered beneficiaries, such as refugees, migrants  and informal workers; and adopting digital verifica - tion and delivery systems, among other pathbreak - ing steps.58 Civil society has been breaking new ground, too. In  many places the Covid-19 pandemic galvanized civil  society organizations to deliver emergency respons - es, in some cases taking on new functions.59 In re - sponse to expanded emergency government powers,  some civil society entities have beefed up watchdog  activities, and still others are pushing to address so - cial, economic and political imbalances laid bare by  the pandemic. As the Covid-19 pandemic has shown, the growing  mismatch between the world as it is (or is becoming)  and conventional ways of understanding and doing  things, such that more and more of life lacks an ob - vious compass or structure, can be seen as an oppor - tunity to do something new. It can be an opportunity  to imagine, experiment and create, in ways similar to Figure 9 There is much more scope for artificial intelligence to augment human activity than to automate existing tasks Tasks that  humans can doHuman tasks that could be automated New tasks that  humans can do with  the help of machines Note: Figure is illustrative.

Existing institutions  can be transformed, and new ones created, alongside  new leaders, social movements and norms. Much like  many scientists and artists, who are often responding  to practical personal and societal concerns, this pro - cess of ongoing, creative reconstruction at all levels  is a practical response to today’s uncertainty com - plex. We will have to find ways to renew, adapt and  create institutions in the face of their inevitable short - comings in an unpredictably changing world. We will  have to experiment, to cooperate, in order to thrive. If we do not — if we reinforce the status quo, when  the status quo is part of the problem, or limit our as - pirations to a “return to normal” — the gap between  a changing world and intractable norms and institu - tions will widen to a chasm. Opportunities for inno - vation and good leadership then increasingly become  dangerous vacuums in power where the allure of sim - ple recipes and the easy gratifications of finger point - ing combine to make the problem worse. There is  promise and peril in uncertainty and disruption; tip - ping the scales towards promise  — towards hope  — is  up to us. An evolving portfolio of perspectives  helps in a world of worry Tipping the scales towards promise requires that we  keep testing the fences of conventional thinking, to  embrace an evolving portfolio of perspectives from  which to draw, mixing and matching as emerging  contexts require. For instance, policies and institu - tions at all levels need to go beyond assuming that  people are only, or even predominantly, self-inter - ested (see chapter 3). This assumption remains high - ly relevant, but it is does not encompass the totality  of human behaviour. Its limitations have been high - lighted and addressed, at least partially, by com - plementary and pioneering work in behavioural  economics. Still, we must reach for broader perspec - tives of human decisionmaking, ones that consider  the roles of emotions and culture and that explore  how people weave together and change value-infused  narratives about themselves and the various commu - nities they belong to. For example, our relationship  with nature needs renovation, and cultural narratives  are the foundation.“ To respond creatively and nimbly to  today’s uncertainty complex, we need to  bring down barriers to people’s imaginations,  identities and networks, to expand the  idea of what is possible in people’s lives Just as we must widen the vista on human behav - iour, notions of human development must go beyond  a focus on wellbeing achievements, however impor - tant they still are, to include the vital roles of agency  and freedoms in helping people live lives that they  value (see chapter 3). Doing so illuminates the appar - ent paradoxes of our age: progress with insecurity and  progress with polarization. A comprehensive embrace  of human development can act as a lodestar through  turbulent times when cookie-cutter policy lists sim - ply will not do. To respond creatively and nimbly to  today’s uncertainty complex, we need to bring down  barriers to people’s imaginations, identities and net - works, to expand the idea of what is possible in peo - ple’s lives. While crises can present opportunities for  pathbreaking action, we will be better off operating  deliberately and proactively rather than in a chronic  state of emergency response. In an age of layered and  interacting uncertainties, freedoms may not translate  reliably into desired achievements or outcomes. That  is the unfortunate news. But individuals, families and  communities can be empowered to experiment, to try  new things, for their benefit and for others, without  fear of being trapped in poverty, in a single identity or  in one cultural narrative. Rigidities in their many dimensions  — in ideas, in  networks, in narratives  — act as a vise on human cre - ativity; they constrain the generation of new ideas  in response to a changing world. Agency and free - doms are antidotes. Policies, institutions and cultur - al change that promote them tend to be fostered by  cultivating four motivating principles: flexibility, sol - idarity, creativity and inclusion (see also chapter 6).  These principles, which can reinforce one another,  will go a long way in making policies and institutions  more fit for purpose. The four principles can also have their own inter - nal tensions. Building systems with some stabilizing  redundancies, for example, needs to be balanced  against nimble response capacities. Still, it is hard  to be quick on one’s feet if one is constantly getting  knocked over by a financial meltdown, novel virus or  OVERVIEW 17 monster hurricane. Similarly, there is a give and take  to creative exploration and concerted, purposeful  action anchored in human rights. Striking the right  balance among the four motivating principles will be  key, and trust is essential to doing so. People will be  suspicious of the negotiation table if they fear that the  chair will be constantly jerked out from under them.  Policy development will be an iterative, trial-and-er - ror process in which we must all learn from each  other. Policies and institutions to invest, insure and innovate There are no policy panaceas, no one-size-fits-all  approaches. Even so, some policies form the build - ing blocks for countries and communities as they  navigate today’s uncertainty complex towards more  hopeful futures. They fall into three overlapping, mu - tually reinforcing categories: investment, insurance  and innovation  — the Three I’s (figure 10; see also  chapter 6). Investment should connect the dots. Nature-based  human development can protect and enhance natural  resources while protecting people from shocks, pro - moting economic and food security and expanding  the choices available to them. Such investments are  especially relevant at the local level, speaking to the need for investing in governance that is connected to  people on the ground, that builds bridges among pol - icy and institutional silos and that ensures all voices  are heard. Investments are needed, too, on the other  end  — in global public goods. The new uncertain - ty complex is often driven by global phenomena, so  responding to it can require global cooperation. The  additional investment to avoid future pandemics is  estimated to be only $15 billion a year.60 This is a tiny  fraction of the economic cost of the Covid-19 pan - demic, a cost that exceeds $7 trillion in lost produc - tion and $16.9 trillion in emergency fiscal responses.61  Investments in global pandemic preparedness make  good sense, given the devastating human costs. Insurance provides an essential stabilizing force  in the face of uncertainty. To start, structures that  manage a variety of risk in people’s lives, primarily  in various forms of social protection, need to be re - vitalized and modernized, including for people in in - formal or other precarious employment, such as gig  workers. We need to reverse course away from risk  segmentation and move towards a broader sharing of  risk. More countercyclical social protection measures  can be automatically triggered by certain indicators,  such as the loss of a job or a drop in income, while  ensuring their inclusivity. Such measures played im - portant roles in many countries in protecting people  from some of the worst impacts of the global financial  Figure 10 Making people more secure though investment, insurance and innovation Opportunities for broad participation Macroprudential policies Social protection  Access to basic services Protection of human rights Public deliberationAdaptive peacebuilding Social innovation Addressing misinformation and enhancing media literacy Data and measurementsEnergy eﬃciency Insurance InnovationInvestmentProvision of global public goods Nature-based human development Preparation to face environmental changes Source: Human Development Report Office. 18 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. One of the bene - fits of automatic triggers is that they require less polit - ical wrangling at already stressful moments, helping  target political capital to the unique features of a new  challenge rather than continually plugging holes in  leaky safety nets. Universal basic services, such as health and edu - cation, are important investments in their own right,  as evidenced in the Sustainable Development Goals,  and for inclusively expanding human development.  They also afford an important insurance function,  helping stabilize people in the face of seemingly re - lentless shocks. This can encourage experimentation.  People are loath to try new things if doing so risks  their or their family’s health and education and  threatens to yank them irreversibly down a yawning  socioeconomic ladder. “ Innovation will be at the heart of  successfully navigating the many unforeseen,  unknowable challenges ahead Investments in preparedness, not just for shocks  but also for societal transitions, can be well worth the  cost. Equally important are investments in promot - ing and protecting human rights and in deliberative  mechanisms that enable public reasoning in a par - ticipatory, inclusive way. Together they help insure  against polarization. Innovation will be at the heart of successfully navi - gating the many unforeseen, unknowable challenges  ahead. Some readymade tools will help, others will be  modified and updated for new contexts and still oth - ers will be built from scratch. In part, innovation has  to do with new technologies and ensuring that they  reach everyone. Computational capacities amount - ing to millions of Apollo missions to the moon are  now in the hands of everyone with a smartphone,  which is just about everybody.62 In developing coun - tries mobile phones have reshaped financial transfers  and access to information, such as weather forecasts  and wholesale market prices. New insurance models  are needed that respond to complex new risk para - digms: risks that are increasingly synchronized across  geographies and sectors, that span generations and  that harm natural resources. The “right” role for governments in innovation is  an important question, and governments have big roles in fostering climates for innovation. There was  widespread support when governments threw their  full weight behind Covid-19 vaccines, committing  to staggering prepurchase orders of then-unprov - en technologies. Governments were a driving force  and active development and distribution partner  throughout, ushering in and deploying a lifesaving  new technology at astonishing speed. (The contrast  with the relatively anaemic action on climate change,  no less an emergency than Covid-19, is stark.) Inno - vation policy frameworks, which are intimately tied  to other areas such as competition and patent laws,  have enormous implications across sectors, from  access to medicines and energy to food and water  security. Innovation does not have to be big to produce big  results. Major social media platforms have enact - ed policies such as notices, warnings and links to  resources in a bid to combat misinformation. For  example, links to official information by the World  Health Organization are suggested under posts men - tioning Covid-19 on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube  and TikTok. Twitter reminds users when they are  sharing an article without opening the link first (see  chapter 4). Fact-checking initiatives have been cre - ated by users on these same platforms, and media  plurality has been strengthened through new and  independent outlets that could not exist or have the  means to inform in the traditional media landscape,  often at the local and grassroot levels. Governments  can also take prudent steps to combat misinforma - tion while respecting and promoting people’s human  rights and freedoms. Sometimes the answer might not be complex. The  simple addition of the retweet button on Twitter has  enabled information, including misinformation, to go  viral. Modifying its use, as some have argued, could  go a long way in curbing some of the more troubling  features of social media.63 Course correcting in this  way  — practical solutions to practical problems  — will  be key to navigating the new uncertainty complex. Innovation is more than technologies as we un - derstand them conventionally in terms of vaccines  or smartphones. Equally important is social innova - tion, which is a whole-of-society endeavour. Adap - tive peacebuilding, which focuses on emergent  bottom-up, participatory processes rather than ad - hering to a set recipe, is a case in point.64 Much can be  OVERVIEW 19 learned from its application in Rwanda for healing,  transitional justice and conflict resolution (see chap - ter 6). Cultural change opens opportunities for collective action Policies and institutions are embedded in social con - texts, so aspects such as narratives matter a lot, too.  Everyone is immersed in social contexts, with cul - ture understood not as a fixed variable working in the  background but as a toolkit that changes over time  and that individuals and groups use strategically in  society. When it comes to choices about the future, people  appear to be motivated less by accurate scenarios of  what the future may hold than by collectively held  narratives.65 Much of the current information about  the future, in the form of assessments, such as those  issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change or Intergovernmental Science-Policy Plat - form on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services,66 are  anticipatory. As crucial as they are, it is important to  consider also having assessments towards imagining  more desirable futures.67 The importance of culture is finding its way into  many other areas, including economics and law. The  work of Robert Shiller explains dynamics in asset  prices as well as business cycles in terms of “narrative  economics.”68 Karla Hoff and James Walsh suggest  that law affects behaviour not only by changing in - centives and information (a coordination function) or  through its expressive role (as a guidepost for social  norms) but also with the potential to change cultural  categories.69 Shifting culture, for good or ill, is possible and can  happen quickly. Education can be a powerful tool to  open the potential for new perspectives in younger  generations, not just through curricula but also by en - visaging schools as spaces of inclusion and diversity.  Social recognition by elites of all types, from politi - cians and celebrities to social media influencers and  community leaders, is an important mechanism for  cultural change. Media in its many forms plays a big  role here. In Bangladesh a popular animated televi - sion show reduced the cultural and religious stigma  of girls going to school in rural areas and increased  their attendance.70 In Ghana and Kenya the Time to Change campaign made inroads into reducing men - tal health stigma.71 The issue is not just about recipients of pro - grammes or target audiences but also about who is  deciding on and delivering the messages. For exam - ple, women’s representation in political bodies shifts  policy priorities and expands aspirations for other  women and girls. Social movements have important  roles as well in advancing human rights and changing  cultural norms and narratives to expand agency and  freedoms (see chapter 6). “ Walls between our social connections  are perhaps more insidiously damaging and  polarizing than walls between nations Essential to flexible and adaptable narratives, in  building trust and social cohesion for more hopeful  futures, is the freedom for each person to have and  move among different identities in different social  contexts (see chapter 4).72 Walls between our social  connections are perhaps more insidiously damag - ing and polarizing than walls between nations. The  bridges that connect different groups are among our  most important assets. Good leaders rehabilitate and  strengthen them and help us use them  — especially  in the face of unknowns. Demagogues try to burn  them down, replacing fluid connection, exchange  and learning with zero-sum, us-versus-them narra - tives. Instead of trying out cultural scripts precisely  when experimentation matters most, people become  trapped by them. Where we go from here is up to us We must learn to live with today’s uncertainty com - plex, just as we must learn to live with Covid-19. This  year’s Human Development Report challenges us to  aspire to more than mere accommodation, however.  By unlocking our human potential, by tapping into  our creativity and diversity anchored in trust and sol - idarity, it challenges us to imagine and create futures  in which we thrive. The encouraging words of the  late, great poet and civil rights activist Maya Angelou  ring as true as ever, reminding us “to bring all our en - ergies to each encounter, to remain flexible enough to  notice and admit when what we expected to happen  20 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 did not happen. We need to remember that we are  created creative and can invent new scenarios as fre - quently as they are needed.”73 Where we go from here is up to us. One of the great  lessons of our species’ history is that we can accom - plish a lot with very little if we work together towards  shared goals. If there is a secret ingredient to human  magic, that must be it. The challenges in the Anthro - pocene and in sweeping societal transformations are  huge, even daunting, all the more so for countries and  communities struggling with the most dramatic and  unjust deprivations. Insecurity and polarization make things worse. Amid so much uncertainty, the truth is  that we are not going to get it right, maybe not even  most of the time. In this turbulent new era we can  set the direction but cannot guarantee the outcome.  The good news is that we have more tools than ever to  help us navigate and course correct. But no amount of  technological wizardry is a substitute for good lead - ership, collective action or trust. If we can start fixing  the human side of the planetary ledger  — and this Re - port tries to highlight how  — then the future, however  uncertain, will be more promise than peril, just as it  should be. OVERVIEW 21  PART I Uncertain times,  unsettled lives 24 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022PART I Uncertain times, unsettled lives Uncertainty is not new, but its dimensions today are  taking ominous new forms. A new “uncertainty com - plex” is emerging, never seen before in human histo - ry. Part I of this Human Development Report explores  what this uncertainty complex is, how it is unsettling  lives the world over and what it has to do with human  development. Chapter 1 parses the three volatile, in - teracting strands that constitute the uncertainty com - plex: the planetary pressures and inequalities of the  Anthropocene, the pursuit of societal transformations to ease those pressures and widespread polarization  across and within countries. Chapter 2 illuminates  how uncertainties of all stripes constrain human de - velopment via their negative impacts on mental well - being. Chapter 3 argues that narrow assumptions  about human behavior, alongside simplistic notions  of development progress, limit people’s ability to re - spond creatively to a world in flux. Doubling down on  human development in its fullest sense offers a hope - ful path forward in uncertain times. PART I — UNCERTAIN TIMES, UNSETTLED LIVES 25  A new   uncertainty complex PART I — UNCERTAIN TIMES, UNSETTLED LIVESCHAPTER 1 28 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022Feelings of distress have been on the rise for almost  everyone everywhere, even before the Covid-19  pandemic. Yet conventional measures of wellbeing  suggest that, on average, life has never been better  for our species. What is going on? Why are people so worried, and  what worries them? This chapter argues that a new uncertainty complex  is emerging, driven by three novel sources of  uncertainty that interact at a global scale: • The intertwined planetary pressures and  inequalities of the Anthropocene. • The pursuit of just societal transformations to ease  those pressures. • Widespread, intensifying societal polarization,  delaying necessary action for change. Together, they are painting a picture of uncertain  times and unsettled lives.CHAPTER 1 A new uncertainty complex A world of worry in uncertain times A war between countries in Europe reawakens fear  of global nuclear conflagration. A volatile geopoliti - cal context1 coexists with a pandemic that continues  to kill and frighten more than two years since it was  declared. Behind the headlines progress in human  development has gone into reverse  — with worsening  trends in poverty, food insecurity, forced displace - ment and many compounding inequalities.2 For the  first time on record, the global Human Development  Index (HDI) has dropped for two years in a row, taking  the world back to just after the adoption of the 2030  Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris  Agreement (figure 1.1). Every year a few countries face  declines on the HDI, but over 90 percent of countries  saw their HDI value drop in either 2020 or 2021 (fig - ure 1.2). Furthermore, while only a third of very high  HDI countries saw a decline in 2021 (compared with  over 90 percent in 2020), about 60 percent of low and  medium HDI and high HDI countries did (figure 1.3). There is little doubt that these are uncertain times,3  as people feel less sure about what the future holds.  Even before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, six of seven people in the world reported feeling insecure about  many aspects of their lives, with concerns rising the  most in very high HDI countries (see chapters 3 and  4 on the links between uncertainty and insecurity).4 Life has always been uncertain.5 The world has  faced wars, pandemics and massive natural hazards  before. Today’s uncertainty is not necessarily any  greater than in the past. If anything, given record  achievements in average standards of living and in - comes, with astonishing technological progress, we  could be expected to be more ready than ever to meet  uncertain times. Yet, we display high, and often ris - ing, concern about the future. So, what is going on?  Why are people so worried, and what worries them?  If today’s world is not more uncertain than the past’s,  are today’s uncertain times different? If so, how? And  how do they relate to human development? This chapter presents evidence that people are  feeling distressed and explores what they may be  worrying about. While it cannot be established that  there is more uncertainty today than in the past, there  is a novel context for uncertainty. The novelty comes  from three interacting layers of uncertainty, super - imposed on ongoing development challenges.

CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 29 first is associated with the Anthropocene’s dangerous  planetary change and its interaction with inequalities.  The second is the purposeful efforts and intentions to  transition towards new ways of organizing industri - al societies  — purporting transformations similar to  those in the transition from agricultural to industrial  societies.6 The third is the intensification of political  and social polarization across and within countries  —  and of misperceptions about information and across groups of people  — facilitated by how new digital tech - nologies are often being used.7 This new and interact - ing “uncertainty complex” is unequal and universal;  it can exacerbate inequalities, yet like the ongoing  pandemic, it touches us all. The interaction of these three layers of uncertainty  implies that threats to people and planet compound,  with events rippling through our socially and ecologi - cally connected societies in multiple and unpredictable Figure 1.2 Drops in Human Development Index values were widespread during the Covid-19 pandemic, with  over 90 percent of countries suffering a decline in either 2020 or 2021 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021Share of countries for which an  HDI value was calculated that experienced  a decline in HDI value in that year (%)Global ﬁnancial crisis 2324 17151211991397588554620 889910101112 8987 51Covid-19 pandemic Note: The period of the global financial crisis is indicative.

Consider how the war in Ukraine is compound - ing a global food insecurity crisis.8 Consider how the  Covid-19 pandemic, in addition to the health impacts,  also devastated economies and reversed progress in  gender equality.9 Many of the threats, in isolation, are  not new. But the confluence of pandemics, the inven - tion of vaccines in record time, the digital proliferation  of misinformation, the breakdown of supply chains,  the strong market concentrations for essential goods,  the loss of biodiversity  — have all interacted to present  a “complex mixture of the precedented and the un - precedented” at a speed and scale never before seen.10 Rising insecurity amid unprecedented  material prosperity — for some Large-scale text analysis identifying language trends  in books over the past 125 years reveals a sharp in - crease in expressions reflecting cognitive distortions  associated with depression and other forms of mental  distress (see chapter 2).11 Over the past two decades  the language reflecting overly negative perceptions  of the world and its future has surged (figure 1.4).12 In- deed, today’s distress levels are unprecedented,13 ex- ceeding those during the Great Depression and both world wars. The analysis of more than 14 million  books in three languages signals cultural, linguis - tic and psychological shifts beyond changes in word  meaning, writing and publishing standards or the  books considered. Indeed, literature has been thought  of as mirror of our societies, and studies show that  text expressions reflect emotional states14 and some - times anticipate broader social and political changes.15 Other studies  —on,  for example, online behav - iour16 and analysis of emotional expressions on social  media17— echo these findings.18 The Covid-19 pan - demic and uncertainty about the impacts and spread  of the disease sparked rapid surges in online search - es for acute and health- and economic-related anxie - ty.19 While reflecting the concerns of only those with  internet access, the measures coincide with survey  data20 across geographic locations.21 Still other stud - ies show that when events are sudden or unexpected,  online behaviour can indicate shared sentiments.22 People report feeling more distressed and insecure  about their lives and the future. While perceived in - security is higher in low and medium HDI countries,  some of the largest increases in feelings of insecuri - ty are in very high HDI countries (figure 1.5).23 Inse - curity, discontent and pessimism loom large across  Figure 1.4 Negative views about the world and the future have surged to unprecedented highs English, United States  (90% conﬁdence interval) Spanish (95% conﬁdence interval) German (95% conﬁdence interval) Null-model (95% conﬁdence interval) 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 20202.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 –0.5z-score World War IWall Street crashWorld War IIGreat Recession Note: Negative views are defined as textual analogues of cognitive distortions in one- to five-word sequences reflecting depression, anxiety and other  distortions, published in 14 million books in English, Spanish and German over the past 125 years.

CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 31 all geographic regions, including countries with the  highest incomes, with some surveys finding that  younger people tend to have a more positive outlook  on the future in some lower-income countries.24 For  instance, while the mentions of threats, such as those  from conflict or natural hazards, in US newspapers  steadily declined from 1900 to about 2010, they have  since shot up, with forecasts of further increases in  coming decades.25 The numbers of people reporting negative affect  —  stress, sadness, anger or worry   and experiencing physi - cal pain—have been on the rise for the past decade and  have hit a record high since the Gallup Global Emotions  Report started assessing these experiences in 2006.26  When excluding physical pain and assessing only feel - ings, research finds that all groups report experiencing  negative affect, with women, people with lower than  tertiary education and people who are underemployed  or unemployed reporting higher absolute levels (figure  1.6). Indeed, a trend of increased stress is discernible  across the world and across socioeconomic groups, de - spite volatility from year to year (figure 1.7).27These patterns of high or increasing worry par - allel improvements in some measures of prosperi - ty, such as the global Human Development Index,  which before the Covid-19 pandemic had reached  record highs.28 The human development perspective  can shed light on this seeming puzzle. Human devel - opment is in part about achievements in wellbeing  (in health, education and standards of living), a cru - cial aspect of people’s capabilities: their ability to be  and do what they value and have reason to value. But  chapter 3 considers other aspects of capabilities that  matter beyond wellbeing achievements. Looking be - yond averages, horizontal inequalities in capabilities  across groups  — reflected, say, in gender and racial  discrimination or in dimensions important for life  in the 21st century, including enhanced capabilities  such as higher education and access to broadband29  — persisted and in many cases widened during the  pandemic. And even progress in basic capabilities has stalled  or reversed.

Half of them are children.31 And while child mortali - ty has declined globally since 1990, children born in  the world’s poorest countries in the world still have  a 1 in 10 risk of not surviving to their fifth birthday,  whereas almost all children born in some of the rich - est countries survive beyond their fifth birthday.32  The long-term effects of the Covid-19 pandemic  and the current inflation in consumer goods prices  —  especially the increased price of food compounded  by the war in the Ukraine  — threaten to exacerbate the  situation for people living in, or on the brink of, pov - erty across the world.  These deprivations and inequalities in capabilities  pose serious challenges on their own but matter even  more when people try to navigate uncertain times  — and  they matter not only to those excluded and left behind.  Indeed, the feedback loops between pre-existing devel - opment challenges and a novel context of uncertainty  “constitute a systemic challenge to social progress.”33  That provides even more reason to explore why so  many people  — even if they have met their basic needs   — perceive themselves as lacking agency (see chapter 3  for a discussion of agency in the human development framework) as they look to the future. Doing so requires  understanding what is novel about today’s uncertain  times  — the new planetary reality of the Anthropocene,  the unprecedented transition from industrial societies  and the new forms of political polarization. Uncertainty driven by dangerous  planetary change in the Anthropocene Never have so many of the planet’s systems been  knowingly affected by a single species. We humans  are driving climate change34 and harming the integri - ty of many of the ecosystems that sustain human lives  and other species. Our choices are shaping the evolu - tion of life on Earth through legacies that will unfold  over millions of years to come.35 Climate change, biodiversity loss and many other  environmental challenges  — from air pollution to  plastics use  — are receiving individual attention.  But the way these and other planetary pressures are  interlinked  — and the speed, scale and scope of the  unprecedented planetary changes unfolding as a  result — has motivated a new framing of this current  context as the Anthropocene  — the age of humans,  where humans’ impact on the planet is so stark that  it is driving dangerous planetary change  — which has  been formally proposed as a new geological epoch.36 The threats to human lives in the Anthropocene are  fundamentally unequal, as they will more quickly and  intensely affect people and countries that have con - tributed less in relative and absolute terms to plane - tary pressures and benefited less from the changes that  drive planetary pressures. As the 2020 Human Devel - opment Report argued, large and often growing ine - qualities and power imbalances are a defining feature  of the Anthropocene, underpinning the destabilizing  dynamics that divert policy attention and may delay  action to ease planetary pressures. But given that the  threats emanating from dangerous planetary change  are driven mainly by humans, the Anthropocene con - text is creating a responsibility for humanity to act.37 If humans have the power to change the planet in  harmful and unequalizing ways, they have the obli - gation to act towards pursuing a safer and more just  world.38 The responsibility to act falls more heavily  on those who account for more of the planetary pres - sures and have more power to change course. People  are not inherently destroyers of nature; they have Figure 1.7 Stress is high and rising, independent of  education Adult population experiencing stress in the last day, by education level (%) 2005 2010 2015 2020 All groups Less than tertiary educationElementary school or less Tertiary complete45 40 35 30 25 Note: Median values are shown due to inconsistencies in the number of ob - servations across countries and years.

A new planetary reality Uncertainty in the Anthropocene is about much more  than climate change. Even with advances in science  and computational power,40 the multiple feedback  loops between social and ecological systems may  imply that our “knowledge of the world, its ecosys - tems and people, their behaviour, values and choices  will always be partial.”41 One key unknown is wheth - er people will appreciate, and take the responsibility  to act on, the power that we have to stop disrupting  planetary processes. Thus, the Anthropocene is char - acterized by far-reaching and complex interactions  between social and planetary systems that engender  a layer of novel uncertainty.42 Beyond warming temperatures,43 human-induced  planetary pressures result in a natural environment  profoundly different from what humans have pre - viously experienced (spotlight 1.1). The frequency  and intensity of extreme storms, droughts, wildfires  and heatwaves have increased since the 1950s.44  The intensification of urbanization and agricultur - al production has disrupted forests, wetlands and  grasslands  — so much that the amount of human - made materials, such as concrete and asphalt, now  outweigh the Earth’s biomass.45 More than 1  million  species face extinction, threatening the integrity of  whole ecosystems.46 “ The Anthropocene is characterized by  far-reaching and complex interactions  between social and planetary systems that  engender a layer of novel uncertainty These phenomena reinforce each other, magnifying  the speed and scale of threats to our natural and social  systems. For example, the warming and acidification  of oceans provoke migration of fish stocks, affecting  food supplies and the livelihoods of coastal communi - ties. Food insecurity and eroded livelihoods can then  prompt migration, change land uses and exacerbate pollution, further weakening ecosystems.47 As anoth - er example, zoonotic diseases are a latent threat: more  than 10,000 virus species have the potential to infect  humans.48 These have so far been contained within  wild animal populations, but with accelerated climate  change and increased human interference with zo - onotic reservoirs, animal to human transmission is ex - pected to increase49 and heighten the risk of new and  more frequent pandemics.50 For example, the intensi - fied human intervention in animal habitats due to ag - ricultural production is associated with more than half  of all zoonotic diseases infecting humans since 1940.51  And climate change may alter the pattern of disease  exposure and infections as warmer temperatures  change the range of disease-  carrying insects.52 More volatility is also expected. Climate change  is predicted to increase both average temperatures  and temperature variability, with temperature fluctu - ations projected to increase by 100 percent at lower  latitudes.53 More than 40 percent of the world’s pop - ulation depends on water sources affected by high  climate variability. By 2080 an estimated 1 billion  additional people are expected to be impacted by  high climate variability and climate-related water  security threats.54 High weather variability reduces  the “ability of economic agents to plan and function  effectively”55 and may impair health56 and econom - ic productivity.57 For example, intraday and interday  temperature variability is associated with increased  mortality risk.58 Many lower-income countries are  disproportionately exposed to increased temperature  fluctuations and lack resources to invest in adapta - tion, leaving them more vulnerable.59 Dangerous planetary changes are shifting the  baseline of hazards,60 but because these changes are  driven largely by humans, our choices matter. The  uncertainty related to the range of possible evolu - tions in emissions61 is driven by both the evolution of  the climate system and its interaction with the choic - es we make. Implementing the Paris Agreement in a  timely manner increases the world’s chances of keep - ing global average temperature increases below 2°C  (figure 1.8).62 For example, the difference between a  1.5°C and a 2°C increase in global temperature expos - es an extra 1.7 billion people to extreme heatwaves.63 The uncertainty about dangerous planetary change  does not spell unavoidable doom and societal col - lapse.64 A balanced reading of the historical record  CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 35 suggests that human societies have, for the most part,  been resilient, flexible and able to respond, adapt and  thrive when confronting major environmental chang - es (see spotlight 1.1).65 Even though the evidence per - tains to circumscribed geographic contexts, there is  reason to believe that even if not all response options  are fully available  — for instance, migration when  there will be fewer areas with temperatures suitable  for human thriving66 — people retain their ability to  adjust and respond, even to a new planetary reality. Unequal contributions, unequal impacts — planetary  pressures and social imbalances reinforcing each other Countries and groups of people that have contributed  less to planetary pressures are projected to bear the largest burdens of dangerous planetary change.67 For  example, mortality and reductions in labour produc - tivity due to warming temperatures will be greater in  low- and middle-income countries,68 leaving them  with fewer resources to adapt to planetary pressures  and adding layers of vulnerability. Moreover, climate change is an inequality mul - tiplier. Consider the stark inequalities in contribu - tions to and impacts of carbon dioxide emissions.  The top 10 percent of the global income distribution  is responsible for almost half of global annual emis - sions, and the bottom 50 percent, only 12 percent of  emissions.69 The inequalities run even deeper at the  top. In 2019 the bottom 50 percent accounted for  1.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per capita,  while the top 10 percent accounted for 31 tonnes per  capita, the top 0.1 percent 467 tonnes per capita and  Figure 1.8 The wide range of possible future warming depends on our choices 2000 2020 2040 2060 2080 21000.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5 5%–95%Percentiles 17%–83% 33%–67% Median (50%)SSPs 1a APS45 2aSSP1–2.6 SSP1–1.9SSP2–4.5Other comparable studies based on 2030 Nationally Determined Contributions and long-term targetsChange in global mean surface temperature relative to 1850–1900 (ºC) B A APSBA 02040506080100 2.0°C1.5°CExceedance pr obability (%) 2000 2100B AB A 2b2b1b  SSP is Shared Socioeconomic Pathway.

Unmitigated climate  change may drive up to 132 million people into pov - erty in the coming decade.73 Planetary pressures may  also exacerbate horizontal inequalities or even open  new gaps between groups.74 For instance, future risks  of flooding in the United States are expected to affect  mainly low-income Black communities.75 And barri - ers to women’s participation in decisionmaking work  against policies and resource allocations that address  women’s specific vulnerabilities to environmental  change.76 As seen above, curbing emissions at the top of the  income distribution would have a great impact,77 but  when those responsible for planetary pressures are  not equally affected by them and believe they have  the resources to shield themselves from the adverse  effects, incentives to ease planetary pressures are dis - torted. The choices of high-income earners are as - sociated with consumption and production patterns  that account for a disproportionate share of plane - tary pressures. These choices are driven by many fac - tors, but social norms among high-earners and peer  effects influence the lifestyles they expect.78 Their  social context determines not only choices but also  aspirations.79 The channel through which planetary pressures are  affected by inequality runs through actual choices as  well as through aspirations. Aspirations can play an  important role as an incentive for effort with positive  individual and collective outcomes80 and in enhanc - ing human development.81 The reference frames of  aspirations for adjacent, but lower, income groups  are influenced by the behaviour of higher earners. As  reference points change, more and more people may  be influenced to behave in ways that add to planetary  pressures. Such dynamic “expenditure cascades” show how demand for large housing, large cars and  other large goods has increased even where median  incomes are stagnant.82 If access to these position - al goods becomes harder and the referent of aspira - tions is seen to be out of reach, the positive effects of  aspiration can instead lead to alienation and frustra - tion.83 This mismatch between aspiration and reali - zation has implications for people’s wellbeing (it can  increase depression).84 But it can also change people’s  perception of the future from positive to negative and  their sense of agency over the future from high to  low85 — leading to more pessimistic views. As a result,  there will be less of a concern about how individual  behaviour affects future outcomes. And alienation  and frustration can, in turn, contribute to polariza - tion, making collective action towards easing plane - tary pressures more difficult. No second chances: Existential  threats in the Anthropocene To see how the uncertainties in the Anthropocene are  novel, consider existential threats. For the first time  in human history, anthropogenic existential threats  loom larger than those from natural hazards.86 This  started with the advent of nuclear weapons, with  escalating technological power reaching the point  where we are able to threaten our own destruction.  Nuclear war posed an existential risk:87 the perma - nent destruction of humanity’s long-term potential.  Throughout most of human history, the existential  risks to our species emanated exclusively from natu - ral hazards, independent of human action  — including  large asteroid impacts or massive volcanic events,  such as those leading to mass extinction events in  the geological timescale.88 Humans have always had  power to inflict much harm on each other and on na - ture, but only in the Anthropocene have they reached  the potential to kill much of the global population and  destroy the potential of future societies.89 The spectrum of anthropogenic existential threats  is large and growing. In addition to the prospect of  nuclear war, threats include artificial intelligence  (AI), genetic engineering and nanotechnology, as  well as the dangers of planetary pressures and their  interactions.90 They may be deliberate, as in the use  of nuclear force. Or they may be accidental, such as  CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 37 the spread of a virus from a lab, or they may emerge  from ungovernable technological development.91  Heightened political polarization and conflict may  increase the existential threats, including through  nuclear war or biological warfare.92 The drivers of a  possible nuclear conflict may be linked, both in exac - erbating the risks and in magnifying the impacts for  human lives and the planet (spotlight 1.2).93 “ Easing planetary pressures would entail a  fundamental transformation in how societies  live, work and interact with nature. This  transformation engenders its own novel layer  of uncertainty, because, like the Anthropocene  reality, it is unprecedented and uncharted While the existential risks of nuclear war might  be easily imagined, the existential risks of slow-on - set climate change or biodiversity loss may not be  as evident. With continued human pressures on the  planet, tipping points  — beyond return  — can inflict ir - reversible damage to ecosystems and to the benefits  humans derive from them. If tipping points interact,  they may have catastrophic and cascading conse - quences.94 For example, climate change is provoking  Arctic sea-ice loss, which contributes to a slowdown  of the Atlantic circulation, which could disrupt the  West African monsoon and trigger drought in the  Sahel, dry up the Amazon and warm the Southern  Ocean, further accelerating the melting of Antarctic  ice. Amazon forest dieback would distort the stabil - ity of the Earth’s biosphere, with large-scale conse - quences, including massive biodiversity loss and  unprecedented rises in carbon dioxide concentra - tions in the atmosphere.95 While uncertainty remains  about the exact “location” of tipping points and the  full consequences of crossing one, they are just “too  risky to bet against.”96 Realizing the power that humans have over our en - tire planet implies the responsibility to act. Recogniz - ing anthropogenic existential threats also provides an  obligation to lower, indeed to eliminate, existential  risk. In the same way that the Anthropocene provides  a unifying framework to understand how human  choices drive planetary pressures that result in dise - qualizing dangerous planetary change, eliminating  existential risk  — or promoting existential security  —  is the ultimate nonrenewable resource and demands reflecting on the type of institutions needed to reach  existential security (spotlight 1.3). Uncertainty emerges from complex  transitions to ease planetary pressures Adapting to the uncertainty brought about by the An - thropocene reality just described is a tall order. In  addition to adaptation, it is crucial to ease the plan - etary pressures that are driving dangerous planetary  changes. Easing planetary pressures will also mitigate  some of the uncertainties.97 Easing planetary pressures would entail a funda - mental transformation in how societies live, work  and interact with nature, comparable to the transi - tions to agricultural societies and from agricultural  to industrial societies.98 That calls for us to work with   — not against — nature (spotlight 1.4). This transfor - mation engenders its own novel layer of uncertainty,  because, like the Anthropocene reality, it is unprec - edented and uncharted. Uncertainty also emanates  from the fact that transformations involve multiple  social and ecological factors, and their interactions,  playing out over the long term of the transitions at  stake. Even if many of these transitions have in some  ways been charted and modelled (singly or in parts  of the world), there is also modelling and analytical  uncertainty. Central in all this is transforming how societies  generate energy and use materials.99 That will involve  shifting both production and consumption patterns,  underpinned by how human behaviour interacts  with institutions. And that interaction shapes, and is  shaped by, incentives, social norms and values. The 2020 Report proposed representing advancing  human development while easing planetary pressures  as paths taking countries towards the aspirational  space of the green triangle in figure 1.9.100 While the  world had moved in that direction over the past 30  years, it has done so far too slowly and in a way that  leaves higher human development strongly correlat - ed with greater planetary pressures. The needed scale  and speed of this transition should not be oversimpli - fied or minimized, given the ambition of the required  shifts101 — and that, along with complexity of the tran - sition, adds a new layer of uncertainty.102 Transitional uncertainty has several dimensions,  including those associated with a move towards a  38 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 low-carbon economic development path.103 Beyond  the physical uncertainties of climate change are the  uncertainties associated with our deliberate poli - cy choices  — such as altering carbon taxes, shifting  economies away from carbon-intensive industries or  adopting new technologies.104 Some of the uncertainty is associated with who  will win and who will lose as the process unfolds,  which will likely differ across regions and groups  —  recognizing that some are better equipped than oth - ers to benefit from new opportunities.105 One possible  manifestation of uncertainty could be economic inse - curity (spotlight 1.5). For instance, the green econo - my could add more than 24 million jobs worldwide by  2030.106 But these jobs will not necessarily be in the  same regions that stand to lose jobs as fossil fuel in - dustries shut down,107 nor will they require the same  set of skills as in a fossil fuel–based economy. The  economic gains from phasing out coal could amount  to as much as 1.2 percent of global GDP every year until 2100  — but the question remains about how  these gains would be distributed across countries and  across individuals.108 If distributional effects are per - ceived as unfair or if people are left without the sup - port to adapt to a new economic reality, transitions  may be met with resistance, dissent and dispute.109 The outcomes of past transitions have been large - ly unplanned and unintentional. But the expansion of  knowledge and science and our awareness of the An - thropocene reality imply that the transitions to ease  planetary pressures are purposeful and deliberate.  The goal of the transitions is clear  — to move to the as - pirational space of high human development and low  planetary pressures  — even if much uncertainty re - mains about the pathways that would take us there.110 Uncertainties stem not only from the types of pol - icy choices that are adopted but also from how they  are designed and implemented. Success depends on  their perception  — on their social acceptance by dif - ferent segments of the public and those that hold  positions of power. Transitions depend on technol - ogy, and the resulting efficiency gains from it and  how they are distributed. Explored here are chang - es required to ease planetary pressures and the layer  of uncertainty associated with energy and resource  transitions. Energy transitions: Making their way, but  too slowly and amid great uncertainties Energy transitions from fossil fuels towards renewa - bles are driven by new technologies and lower costs.111  While fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas and oil still  produce two-thirds of global electricity,112 renewables  are expected to become the dominant source of glob - al energy supply by 2040.113 But this is only one of  many possible future outcomes. The outcomes vary  widely under three scenarios of the International En - ergy Agency: net-zero emissions, stated policy sce - narios and announced pledges to reduce greenhouse  gas emissions (figure 1.10). Uncertainty can unfold as consequences emerge.  Biofuels, originally thought to be an excellent alterna - tive for fossil fuels, also pose a variety of challenges114  — with implications for land use,115 carbon footprint,116  deforestation impacts,117 biodiversity loss,118 water  competition119 and poverty impacts,120 among others.

CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 39 Uncertainty is also associated with prospects for de - veloping technologies key to the energy transition,  which are not yet in place. Consider energy storage,  which is critical to addressing the intermittency of  supply due to daily and seasonal differences in renew - able power. While a handful of technologies are avail - able, much more is needed to enhance technological  solutions, lower costs and make transmission more ef - ficient. Even with advances in battery storage, adop - tion remains limited in most low- and middle-income  countries due to policy, financial and regulatory bar - riers. Options sought beyond short-term energy stor - age solutions, such as lithium-ion batteries, include  sustainable, cost-efficient long-duration energy stor - age systems, which are a long way off.121 Another dimension of uncertainty is how the fi - nancial system, which assumes a stable climate, will  evolve.122 A shift away from carbon-intensive assets  will expose some investors, who may resist and at - tempt to slow a move towards a low-carbon path.123  Governments are now paying more attention to cli - mate-related financial risks. For example, a 2021 ex - ecutive order by US President Joseph Biden requires  clear and accurate disclosure of climate-related fi - nancial risks to safeguard physical assets as well as  financial markets from climate change–related risks.124 The objective is to protect communities and families  as the United States transitions to the net-zero emis - sions target by 2050. Global and regional mechanisms are also working  to facilitate a low-carbon transition in the financial  sector. The Task Force for Climate-Related Financial  Disclosure seeks to provide investors with informa - tion on climate change–related risks in their portfoli - os. With the same inspiration a consortium of central  banks and financial supervisors established the Net - work for Greening the Financial System.125 The EU  Taxonomy, which classifies environmentally sus - tainable economic activities, supports transitioning  to net-zero emissions by 2050 and implementing  the European Green Deal; the EU Delegated Act has  been formalized to set the screening criteria for the  environmental objectives of new economic activities.  And European countries are stepping up various mit - igation efforts, such as ending the sale of new diesel-  and gas-powered cars in 14 years and imposing tariffs  on goods imported from countries with lax environ - mental laws.126 The volatility in oil and gas prices during the Covid- 19 pandemic and now as the war in Ukraine unfolds  is sending shock waves around the world.127 Oil-   exporting countries experienced large fiscal deficits Figure 1.10 Energy transitions towards renewables can unfold in different ways for different sectors –2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14OtherBuilding sTransportIndus tryElectricity and heatNet zero emissions Announced pledges  to reduce greenhouse  gas emissions  Stated policy scenarios Gigatonnes of carbon dioxide2050 2020 Source: IRENA 2021. 40 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 when oil prices dropped.128 But a range of factors,  including the conflict in Ukraine and economic re - covery as Covid-19 concerns have eased, have led to  a rapid increase in oil prices, a boon to oil-  exporting  countries but also a driver of inflation almost  everywhere.129 The uncertainty associated with energy transi - tions has unsettled people who perceive it as unjust.  French villages and small towns saw protests against  rising petrol prices again in 2021, reminiscent of the  “yellow vest” movements of 2018, Spain saw demon - strations against energy bills and Greece faced social  unrest with the closure of coal mines.130 This even as a  large numbers of jobs are being created in the renew - able energy sector.131 Yet while it is anticipated that  more jobs will be created than lost in energy transi - tions, whether the transitions will be just will depend  on how they are managed.132 Current global pledges to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions cannot safeguard against dangerous cli - mate change.133 Carbon prices remain far too low to  effectively curb emissions. Only 22 percent of global  carbon emissions are under a carbon pricing scheme.134  And implementation remains a challenge even for  commitments made to phase out fossil fuel subsidies   — no date has been set to achieve the target globally,  and 2021 saw the highest increase in fossil fuel sub - sidies since 2010.135 Uncertainty associated with the  transition can be heightened by the realization that  more ambition is needed, along with the resistance  to change from powerful lobby groups or public con - cerns with loss of employment in specific sectors.136  And the transitions can be drawn out: phasing out coal  in Germany, initiated in the 1980s, is still years from  completion, with concerns about stranded assets and  the insecurity of affected workers and communities.137 “ Deliberate energy transitions are  happening now, backed by policies and  supported by social movements Even so, energy transitions are possible.138 A move  in France to increase nuclear capacity boosted its  share of power from 4 percent in 1970 to 40 percent  in 1982.139 The Netherlands went from having coal  supply 55 percent of its power and crude oil 43 per- cent in 1959 to having natural gas supply 50 per- cent by 1971.140 Deliberate energy transitions are happening now, backed by policies and supported by  social movements.141 Uncertainty associated with managing  material use to ease planetary pressures The shift to low-carbon economies will depend in  part on extracting minerals and using materials that  are key to technologies such as electric cars and solar  panels. The same extraction implies land-use change  and emissions that not only add to planetary pres - sures but have also been linked with serious human  rights violations.142 For example, rare earth elements  can be located in sensitive ecosystems with high bio - diversity, crucial carbon sinks and water resources,  which if exploited could irreversibly damage natu - ral resources. Of the 50 million square kilometres of  the Earth’s land currently being mined, about 8 per- cent overlaps with protected areas, 7 percent with key  biodiversity areas and 16 percent with the remaining  areas free of industrial activities and other human  pressures.143 The next wave of renewable energy  growth could affect 30 percent of protected areas and  key biodiversity areas and compromise 60 percent of  the remaining areas free of industrial activities and  other human pressures.144 Ongoing conflict diverts  resources and attention from protecting sensitive  ecosystems and vulnerable populations. With ener - gy demand projections based on existing policies and  policy announcements, mineral demand is expected  to double. And under a sustainable development sce - nario, where energy policies are consistent with the  Paris Agreement goals, mineral demand is expected  to quadruple (figure 1.11).145 Another dimension of uncertainty is related to the  future of seabed and space mining. Growing demand  for renewables is driving mining companies and start - ups to invest in opportunities under the ocean.146 Sci - entists warn that disturbing an otherwise quiet and  dark seabed that provides a unique ecosystem for ma - rine life will have ramifications not only locally but  also thousands of kilometres away. The first experi - ment in seabed mining in 1989, DISCOL,147 demon - strated that species did not recolonize after more than  30 years. With technology ahead of the curve and reg - ulations catching up, the commercial exploitation of  seabed mining could be devastating for marine life.  CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 41 And as technology races ahead to make space min - ing a near possibility, questions are being raised about  regulations.148 There is no legal agreement among  nations to prohibit mining celestial bodies; the two  treaties in place allow for free exploration and use of  space resources, leaving choices to miners. Moreover,  strong pressures to look for answers beyond our own  planet may divert attention from ourselves.149The demand for materials goes beyond that for  the energy transition. It is adding to planetary pres - sures with implications that will span deep into the  future. A plastic water bottle can remain in nature for  approximately 450 years.150 And since the 1950s we  have produced more than 8 billion tonnes of plastic.151  In 2020 the world’s consumption of materials ex - ceeded 100 billion tonnes a year,152 twice the amount Figure 1.11 The energy transition demands minerals and materials that add to planetary pressures 0510152030Millions of tonnesElectricity networks Electric vehicles Hydro Wind Solar photovoltaicsBattery storage 2020 Stated policies Sustainable Development Scenario 010203045 40 35 25 15 5Index (2020 = 1) Lithium Cobalt Manganese Chromium Copper Silicon Graphite Nickel Rare earth elementsMolybdenum Zinc SilverBy technology By mineral25 Note: The demand for minerals will depend on the types of renewable energy.

To give a  sense of the scale, for the first time in human history,  anthropogenic mass exceeded world’s living biomass  (figure 1.12).156 The challenges with nuclear waste disposal also  point to the need to consider material use in a com - prehensive way. Nuclear resources that are used to  produce clean energy and industrial goods and for  military applications also generate radioactive waste,  which needs to be stored for more than half a million  years  — transmitting responsibilities and challenges to  distant generations.157 Much of the waste is temporar - ily stored underground in tanks, which through wear  and tear may leak radioactive material into our soils  and water. About 95 percent of the world’s nuclear  power reactors have produced an estimated 265,000  metric tonnes of spent heavy-metal fuel and 38 mil- lion cubic metres of solid nuclear waste.158Anthropogenic activities are also disrupting bioge - ochemical cycles. Carbon levels are 36 times higher  than preindustrial levels, phosphorous levels 13 times  higher and nitrogen levels 9 times higher.159 The ni - trogen in fertilizers accumulating in nature pollutes  water (excessive nitrates in drinking water), reduces  air quality, depletes the ozone layer and accelerates  global warming and biodiversity loss.160 The exces - sive runoff of nitrogen into rivers and oceans increas - es algae blooms, which are depleting ocean oxygen  and killing aquatic flora and fauna. Satellite images  suggest that about 1.15 million square kilometres of  the ocean surface may be eutrophic zones,161 with a  large part of them dead zones.162 Rapid technological change: A shifting  ground beneath our feet Rapid technological shifts are bringing new ways for  humans to interact with technology, and with each  Figure 1.12 Anthropogenic mass now exceeds the world’s total living biomass Dry weight (teratonnes) 1.6 Biomass2020±6 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 2020Anthr opogenic  mass1.4 1.2 1.0 0.8 0.6 Other (for example, plastic) Metals Asphalt Bricks Aggr egates (for example, gravel) Concrete0.4 0.2 0 Source: Elhacham and others 2020. CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 43 other, creating more novel uncertainties.163 The po - tential gains are massive, but what about the distri - bution of benefits and the differentiated impacts on  people? The eventual emergence of general-purpose  AI could multiply global GDP per person by a factor  of 10  — something that historically took the world  190 years to accomplish, from 1820 to 2010.164 But  these massive potential aggregate gains may be con - centrated among a few, leaving many behind. One  possibility is falling into a Turing trap, where tech - nological and economic power is concentrated and  translated into political power, “trapping a powerless  majority into an unhappy equilibrium.”165 The back - lash against free trade in some high-income coun - tries offers a cautionary tale, given that the aggregate  income gains of globalization through comparative  advantage and specialization were not distributed to  compensate disadvantaged occupations, sectors or  regions. The economic winners gained power and  lost interest in ensuring the equitable distribution of  benefits.166 “ Recent technological changes outpace our  ability to understand their societal implications.  Often disruptive, artificial intelligence,  social media and other new technologies are  changing our lives in fundamental ways Recent technological changes outpace our ability  to understand their societal implications. Often dis - ruptive, AI, social media and other new technologies  are changing our lives in fundamental ways. To illustrate the novel dimensions of uncertain - ty, the following sections briefly consider the digital  age, AI and genetic editing; see chapters 4 and 5 for  further analysis of the implications of technological  change. The digital world — transforming  human-to-human interaction Less than 1 percent of the world’s technologically  stored information was in a digital format in the late  1980s compared with more than 99 percent by 2012.167  Whether the way we connect to our work, how we  communicate with friends and family or what we do  in our free time, digital technology has become an in - dispensable part of many people’s lives. In 2010 the number of machines connected to the internet ex - ceeded the number of people connected to it for the  first time.168 Unlike any previous generation, many  children born after 2008 have extensive exposure to  digital devices early in life. Tempering the initial optimism about the oppor - tunities of new technologies are downsides or un - intended consequences. Mobile phones trace our  movements. AI, reducing human effort in sophisti - cated tasks, can also replicate and amplify stereo - types. Social media, originally meant to connect us,  are contributing to divisiveness. These illustrate how  new technologies bring along unintended conse - quences, engendering uncertainty.169 Firms are bringing in new technologies at an ac - celerated pace to automate production and reduce  costs. Some jobs are being lost, as in accounting,  administration and translation, just as others are  created in big data, digital security and robotics en - gineering. The World Economic Forum projects that  by 2025, 97 million new jobs will be created and  85 million jobs will be lost across 15 industries in 26  economies.170 Industries not keeping pace with the  trend towards automation stand to lose competitive  edge, as will labourers who do not acquire new skills  to keep pace with the changing labour market. This  may also have implications for low- and middle- income countries, which may see a reshoring of  jobs.171 Digitalization is changing human-to-technology  and human-to-human interactions, sometimes radi - cally. Online dating is one example of digitalization-   altered human interaction.172 Human interaction with algorithms has also turned  detrimental in many ways.173 Mobile telephones and  social media lift the voices of marginalized and op - pressed groups but are also tools for those wishing  to do harm.174 Through these platforms groups with  extremist and violent ideologies can expand their  followings.175 The constant connectedness to social media can  have harmful cognitive and emotional effects.176 Neu - roscientists suggest that internet use has altered  the way the brain functions, affecting attention and  memory and making us less sociable and empathet - ic.177 For example, adding a single moral-emotional  word to a tweet increases its retweet rate by 19  per- cent.178 A post that includes indignant disagreement  44 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 obtains twice as many likes and three times as many  comments.179 And the high demand for attention, as  through the overuse of social media, reduces the time  young people have for constructive reflection, shrink - ing the space for future imagining or reflecting on  personal memories.180 Artificial intelligence — making choices for us As our lives become more dependent on AI — from  weather forecasts to financial market transactions to  analysing DNA  — we are delegating human choices.  AI is choosing the news and information we are ex - posed to and suggesting what we should buy. The use of algorithms in social media results  in people’s decreased exposure to counterattitu - dinal news, facilitating the polarization of views.181  Among millennials in many parts of the world, so - cial media outlets are often the dominant source of  news about politics and governments.182 By recom - mending automated videos and news, manipulative  content now easily reaches viewers, amplifying the  spread of disinformation.183 Social media can also  fuel populist, nationalist and xenophobic waves  across societies.184 AI is getting better at creating counterfeit infor - mation and fuelling the spread of disinformation.  Consider how generative adversarial networks cre - ate counterfeit audios and videos.185 These technol - ogies can now be easily used through apps to create  deepfakes. By 2016 more than 50 percent of inter - net traffic was generated by bots.186 Indeed, false in - formation tends to spread more broadly than true  information.187 Social networks can reduce critical  assessment and facilitate the diffusion of conspiracy  theories. “ As our lives become more dependent on  artificial intelligence  — from weather forecasts  to financial market transactions to analysing  DNA  — we are delegating human choices In a similar vein, who is responsible for mistaken  AI decisions? Credit applications are rejected, and  social media posts are deleted based on AI decisions,  while mechanisms to contest these decisions are not  fully developed. Many algorithms are opaque, unreg - ulated and difficult to contest.188 Pattern-recognition algorithms could be applied to target certain people189  or produce disproportional and biased collateral  damages due to imperfections in the code or in train - ing data.190 The use of AI in the military to deploy  autonomous weapons or killer robots raises many  questions.191 Machine learning is also providing firms with mar - ket information that they have never had before, cre - ating new avenues for advertising while potentially  encroaching on consumer privacy. When consumers  purchase online, they reveal their preferences, and  perhaps information about their friends and families,  that companies can use to expand market outreach.  Such data, often provided inadvertently by consum - ers, may transfer information to companies without  constraints on how it may be used.192 Genomic editing—redefining the  realm of possibilities Genomic editing has revolutionized the life scienc - es and medicine through the possibility of changing  the characteristics of living organisms by altering  DNA. CRISPR can support the treatment of a range  of health conditions with relative ease and efficacy.193  For the first time it is possible to increase the lon - gevity of children with progeria, a genetic disorder  that promotes early aging and to reverse blindness.194  CRISPR is also being explored for neurodegenerative  diseases such as muscular dystrophy, Huntington’s  disease and Alzheimer’s disease.195 Genomic editing also raises questions. Somatic cell  editing can change the genes of a particular patient,  while germline editing of egg and sperm cells can  carry the treatment to future generations. Progress  in this field has been so rapid that issues around eth - ics, regulations and societal implications have coun - tries scrambling to catch up. Recently, a researcher  alarmed the world by confirming that he had edit - ed the genes of twin babies.196 There are also many  safety concerns. For example, in an embryo a nucle - ase may not necessarily cut both copies of the target  genes or may start dividing before the corrections are  complete.197 Gene editing in rats, cattle, sheep and  pigs also shows that it is possible to delete or disable  genes in an embryo. Bioethicists argue that it is im - possible to obtain consent on germline editing from  an embryo or from future generations.198 CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 45 Gene editing in the food industry can enhance  productivity and make products resilient to weather  and disease.199 Japan recently authorized a genetical - ly edited tomato variant rich in amino acids (GABA)  that can induce relaxation and lower blood pressure.200  Drought-resistant crops are being developed to keep  yields high in times of reduced water supply, and re - search is under way on whether genetically edited  rice could be resistant to flooding.201 “ The conjunction of uncertainty and  polarization may be paralyzing  — delaying  action to curb human pressures on the planet How should genetically edited food be regulated  and how should consumers be informed? And what  about the labelling of genetically edited food? Sev - eral biotech companies, agribusinesses and food re - tailers are behind an antilabelling drive, while others  advocate otherwis  e —but until these questions are an - swered, uncertainty is likely to persist.202 Uncertainty propelled by polarization:  Delaying action, adding conflict Uncertainty opens space for dispersing beliefs203 and  disagreeing on best courses of action.204 This is not  necessarily a problem. Indeed, when facing un - predictability, societies tend to leverage aggregate  collective knowledge and narratives to mobilize resil - ience.205 But uncertainty can also spur political polari - zation, especially among those averse to uncertainty.206  For example, research finds that in the uncertain af - termath of a shock, such as a financial crisis, support  for political extremes  increases.207 Political polari - zation reduces generalized trust and divides society  into “us” and “them.” It entrenches opinions, under - mines public deliberation and may even reach toxic  levels, with detrimental effects for democratic free - doms and human rights.208 The last decade has seen rapid democratic backslid - ing and increased political polarization in many socie - ties (see chapter 4).209 Trust and belief in democracy  have been declining in parallel with increasing author - itarianism.210 Political polarization has been increas - ing across a diverse set of countries (figure 1.13). The conjunction of uncertainty and polarization  may be paralyzing — delaying action to curb human pressures on the planet. The real paradox of our time  may be our inability to act, despite mounting evi - dence of the distress that human planetary pressures  are causing our ecological and social systems. But  when perspectives of the future are uncertain, people  may draw different conclusions from the same data,211  and scientific uncertainty can be a basis for political  manipulation.212 Indeed, the spread of disinformation  has been found to contribute to deteriorating social  attitudes and polarization.213 In today’s uncertain times cooperation and dia - logue have often taken a backseat, as armed conflicts  and military spending peak.214 Wars and violent con - flicts pose direct threats to lives and livelihoods and  compounding pre-existing vulnerabilities. They add  huge layers of uncertainty to people’s lives and im - pede both individual and collective investments in  human development.215 The number of people living  in areas affected by violent conflict was reaching re - cord levels even before the war in Ukraine. In 2020  about 1.2 billion people lived within 50 kilometres of  a conflict event, almost half of them (560  million) in  places outside so-called fragile contexts.216 Further - more, a large share of the increase in the number of  people living close to conflict events has occurred in  settings where conflict is present but results in fewer  than 10 fatalities, indicating a shift towards insecu - rity and uncertainty that go beyond the most violent  and deadly conflicts.217 Conflict diverts policy attention and resourc - es from sustainable development and can hamper  climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.218  Studies point to the twin crisis of conflict and plane - tary disruption (spotlight 1.6). Warming temperatures  heighten conflict risks,219 as documented in histo - ry,220 with temperature surges linked to higher crime  and interpersonal violence, even outside armed con - flict settings.221 Nature and natural resources are also  becoming a source of contestation.222 But the links  between climate and conflict are not straightforward   — they span socioeconomic, political and ecological  spheres.223 Today, some of the places most exposed  to climate change coincide with fragile and conflict-   ridden contexts, where resources and the capacity for  resilience are already low (see spotlight 1.6). Conflict  hinders access to much-needed climate financing  in fragile and violent conflict contexts.224 The low-   carbon transitions under way can add insecurity by  46 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 opening new areas of contestation  — especially when  coupled with unequal power dynamics and uncer - tainties about land ownership (spotlight 1.7). And now for something completely  different: Novel and layered  drivers of uncertainty Uncertainties are stacking up and interacting. The  novelty of humans’ stark impact on the planet, the  intentional efforts to transform, the fast pace of tech - nological innovation and human development’s em - beddedness in nature invite us to take a step back and  consider the feedback loops and interlinkages be - tween our social and ecological systems.225 With close  interlinkages threats can easily spill over and multi - ply—leading to systemic failure.226 The interaction  of different layers of uncertainty makes the current  context one of systemwide turbulence.227 Extreme weather and climate events interact in ever more  complex ways, shaped both by physical drivers and by  societal contexts.228 Institutions and behaviours cre - ate nonphysical interconnections, with implications  for the impact of natural hazards and the severity of  future extreme events in a series of complex feedback  loops (table 1.1). These interactions between physical and societal  drivers have always been present at the local level.  But over the 21st century the world will confront a  continuously changing baseline, along with more  extreme wet and dry precipitation events that will  present adaptation challenges far beyond anything  already experienced.229 In fact, the changing “nor - mal” will be so substantial that, if traditional meas - ures to identify extreme events are based on what has  been considered “normal,” the entire late 21st centu - ry would be a single large extreme event.230 In other  words the interaction of physical drivers and societal Figure 1.13 Political polarization is on the rise across the world 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 Political p olarization in 2011Political p olarization in 2021 Eastern Europe and Central Asia Latin America and the Caribbean Middle East and North Africa Sub-Saharan Africa Western Europe and North America Asia and the PaciﬁcBeing placed above the line  means that polarization  increased from 2011 to 2021 Source: Adapted from Boese and others (2022). CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 47 forces231 is fundamentally shifting both the baseline  of hazards and their increased variance.232 In the  past, institutions and behaviours evolved over time  to manage the impact of uncertainty and reduce the  vulnerabilities to threats. In the future, patterns of  local adaption will be so disrupted as a result of cli - mate change233 that we may be ill-equipped to handle  nationally and even globally the simultaneous mate - rialization of multiple threats interacting with one an - other in compounding and novel ways (see box S1.6.1  in spotlight 1.6 for one example of a compounding  crisis at the national level). Droughts have rarely, if ever, affected all the major  food producing regions at the same time, providing  opportunities for “global insurance” through trade.  The decline in food supplies in a drought-affected  region could be compensated for by the supply from  other regions free of drought. Now, the risk of global  crop failure will emerge from more frequent spatially  concurrent heatwaves and droughts affecting major  bread  baskets for wheat, maize and soybean.234 Today,  there is almost zero probability of the four countries  that account for the vast majority of global maize ex - ports suffering simultaneous crop harvest losses great - er than 10 percent. But this probability could increase  to almost 90 percent under global warming of 4°C.235  The global impact runs not only through temperature and changes in hydrological patterns but also through  the large changes in global ecosystem productivity set  in motion by the rise in carbon dioxide levels.236 These risks are compounded by strong pressures  to increase efficiency through powerful economies  of scale in food production, concentrating global  food production in only a few breadbaskets. The ho - mogenization of food consumption habits leaves the  world reliant for nourishment on a limited number of  crops from a limited number of places.237 So, behav - ioural and social choices  — diet choices and economic  incentives to concentrate production  — make us in - creasingly vulnerable to synchronized crop failures.238  Furthermore, the loss of crop diversity could desta - bilize entire ecosystems and have adverse economic  and social impacts.239 Conflict weaves in additional layers of uncertain - ty to the increasingly concentrated and homogenous  global food production. Consider the war in Ukraine,  one of the world’s largest wheat producers and ex - porters. The Russian Federation controls much of the  global market share of fertilizer  — a key input in agri - cultural production. The conflict has disrupted grain  and fertilizer exports, contributing to a commodity  price shock, especially among people living in pover - ty.240 Beyond the battle-related deaths and displace - ments, energy insecurity is looming, a food insecurity Table 1.1 Climate hazards driven by compounded physical drivers and societal context Hazard Climatic drivers Societal drivers Drought Precipitation, evapotranspiration, antecedent soil  moisture, temperatureWater management, land-use change Physiological heat stress Temperature, atmospheric humidity, diurnal cycle Urbanization, irrigation Fire risk Temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind,  lightningUrbanization, deforestation Coastal flooding River flow, precipitation, coastal water level, surge,  wind speedHard infrastructure, removal of natural  coastal barriers Flooding at river confluences Precipitation, river water levels, large-scale  atmospheric circulationWater management, urbanization Concurrent heat and drought Temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration,  atmospheric humidityWater management, soil management,  land-use change Concurrent wind and  precipitation extremesWind speed, precipitation, orography, large-scale  atmospheric circulationFew or none Concurrent heat and air pollution Temperature, solar radiation, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen  oxides, ozone, particulate matterUrbanization, agricultural and  industrial activities Note: The table provides examples of how compounding climatic drivers and societal drivers interact to produce connected climate extremes.

Long-term anthropogenic climate change plays into many of these hazards but is omitted here for simplicity. Source: Adapted from Raymond and others (2020). 48 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 crisis is under way and geopolitical instability is on  the rise.241 Indeed, war may be a “trigger of triggers,”  with global ripple effects. The Covid-19 pandemic brought together zoonot - ic disease, inequalities and global socioecological  connectivity. Unequal labour market conditions im - plied that some workers could quickly transition to  remote working arrangements, safeguarding health  and economic livelihoods, but others had to continue  interacting with people or leave their jobs. And while  social protection may have determined whether a  person had the possibility of forgoing work to follow  public health recommendations, political polariza - tion, misinformation and deteriorating trust in sci - ence and institutions were also at play, influencing  whether people were willing to follow the recommen - dations of public health authorities.242 What the future may hold due to pandemics is a  major source of distress,243 and the Covid-19 pan - demic may leave deep scars. Inequality in access to  digital technologies may have widened education  disparities, setting back children in lower-income  countries.244 While higher-income countries could  mobilize massive resources for recovery spend - ing, often by borrowing at record-low interest rates,  lower-  income countries faced tight fiscal conditions  and had to service debt rather than support people in  dealing with the pandemic’s socioeconomic impacts.  Going forward, the differences in recovery spending  between developed and developing economies may  exacerbate differences in growth trajectories.245 Zoonotic diseases and pandemics may be in the  limelight, but health threats from anthropogenic im - pacts on the planet expand beyond that. Accelerat - ed biodiversity loss is a threat to food security, since  much of our agricultural production depends on pol - linators.246 Food security is a looming global crisis,  with 2.4 billion people facing moderate to severe food  insecurity in 2020. The loss of pollinators also affects  the diversity and availability of different nutrients.247  The loss of biodiversity reduces the potential for new  medical discoveries and poses a direct threat to local  and traditional medicinal practices.248 Pollution is be - coming a major health threat, causing approximately  9 million premature deaths globally in 2015, 92 per- cent of them in low- and middle-income countries.249  Exposure to air pollution has also been linked to high - er Covid-19 mortality.250A mismatch between interacting  uncertainties and resilience strategies The interaction of uncertainties casts doubt on the ef - fectiveness of some of the resilience strategies that  have historically been pursued (see spotlight 1.1).  Leveraging trade to cope with local climate extremes  affecting food production, building temperature-in - different energy systems or migrating may be difficult  amid layered and interacting uncertainties. Where  do we migrate if the entire world is affected by si - multaneous natural hazards  — or when inequalities  and political polarization set up barriers to people’s  movement? Can we diversify food supplies through  imports in a world where increasing temperatures  heighten the risk of simultaneous failures of wheat,  maize and soybean harvests251 or where pandemic-in - duced labour shortages, war and geopolitical ten - sions weaken global supply chains?252 “ The interaction of uncertainties casts  doubt on the effectiveness of some of the  resilience strategies that have historically  been pursued. Where do we migrate if the  entire world is affected by natural hazards  — or  when inequalities and political polarization  set up barriers to people’s movement? Our common aspirations, as codified in the 2030  Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Uni - versal Declaration of Human Rights, are indivisible.  Today, many people are losing faith in our collective  ability to meet them.253 Indeed, democratic practices  have been weakening,254 and the inability of coun - tries to come together quickly enough during the  Covid-19 crisis to provide equitable vaccine access,  another illustration.255 UN Secretary-General Antó - nio Guterres has warned repeatedly of a fraying glob - al world order256 and has called on nations to rebuild  global solidarity and multilateral cooperation in the  face of systemic and interconnected threats.257 To meet the “confluence of calamities”258 in the  world today, we need more international cooper - ation, not less, and more solidarity across people,  across generations and with the planet. A main chal - lenge to overcome is that action to ease planetary  pressures is needed now, but some of the benefits will  not materialize until well in the future. Insights from  CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 49 indigenous philosophies bridge these intergenera - tional gaps and may contribute to foster change. In  many of these philosophies, past, present and future  generations share “interwoven histories that shape  […] collective lives and the world” and intergenera - tional responsibilities of “socioenvironmental guardi - anship” are implied.259 Restoring our connection with  the planet and with ourselves, including across gen - erations, and acting in ways that enhance our shared,  intergenerational, collective lives then become  central objectives. Yet these perspectives are often  marginalized in mainstream policy debates, mak - ing the empowerment of indigenous and other mar - ginalized communities not only a matter of justice  but also a matter of gaining insights and ideas that  could benefit humanity as a whole (spotlight 1.8).260 Where we go from here is up to us: will we act  in time to avoid the worst consequences, or will polarization drive disagreement and hinder change?  Will we address the power imbalances and inequal - ities that drive planetary pressures and obstruct  people’s agency? Will the actions taken be enough,  and will they benefit everyone, or will they exac - erbate inequalities, adding strain to already weak - ened social contracts and global cooperation? The  uncertainty complex we face may seem daunting,  but history provides ample evidence of individual  and societal resilience. Inaction in the face of deep  uncertainty and compounding threats to human  development is not an option. Going forward, we  need to be courageous enough to challenge the sta - tus quo and to look into new places, new people  and a diverse set of knowledge traditions for inspi - ration and solutions.261 Indeed, human agency can  be a major driver of large-scale societal change (see  chapter 3). 50 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 Today’s climate crisis has no precedent in Earth’s  history, owing to the combination of its speed, even - tual magnitude, global scale and human cause. Yet  regional and even global climates have changed  profoundly and often abruptly over the roughly  300,000-year history of humanity.1 Anthropologists,  archaeologists, economists, geneticists, geographers,  historians, linguists and paleo scientists have long  attempted to identify how these changes influenced  communities and societies. Scholars in this field  —  recently termed the history of climate and society  (HCS) — typically identify relationships between cli - matic and human histories not only to improve un - derstandings of the past but also to inform forecasts  of the hotter future.2 For over a century the most influential studies in  HCS argued that temperature and precipitation trends  and anomalies caused human populations to either  collapse or undergo subsistence crises. While HCS  scholars have not settled on a common, cross-dis - ciplinary definition of collapse, to them the concept  usually involves a disintegration of socioeconomic  complexity, leading to depopulation, new political  structures and new settlement patterns. HCS scholars  have used statistical and qualitative methods to link  drought and cooling to the collapse of, for example: • The Akkadian Empire in the 3rd millennium BCE. • The societies of the Bronze Age Mediterranean in  the 2nd millennium BCE. • The Western Roman Empire in the 5th and 6th  centuries CE. • The cities of the Classical Maya in the 10th century  CE. • Angkor, capital of the Khmer Empire, in the 15th  century CE. • The Norse settlements of western Greenland in the  15th century CE.3 When examining well-documented and often  comparatively recent periods and places, HCS schol - ars usually concentrate on subsistence crises that culminated in political transformation but not col - lapse. In such studies crises typically afflicted only  one state  — for example, during dynastic transitions  in ancient Egypt or Imperial China — but occasionally  also entire continents, in western Eurasia during the  14th or 17th century, for instance. In this scholarship  the worst-affected civilizations were those with sub - sistence strategies, hydraulic infrastructure, military  and demographic pressures, or inefficient and unpop - ular governments that left them vulnerable to envi - ronmental disruption.4 HCS studies of collapse and crisis inform common  fears that present-day civilizations cannot survive  continued global warming.5 Today’s climate change  will indeed reduce agricultural productivity; limit  the availability of freshwater; increase the severity of  droughts, heat waves and tropical cyclones; and re - shape coastal environments on a speed and scale that  could provoke destabilizing societal responses.6 Yet  the disproportionate emphasis on collapse and crisis  in HCS scholarship partly reflects systematic biases in  how studies in the field are designed, rather than the  most common historical responses to climate change.7 HCS scholars are increasingly exploring the re - silience of past populations to climatic changes and  anomalies. Definitions of resilience in climate-related  fields long privileged “bouncing back” in the wake of  disaster and were eventually criticized for assuming  that social change is inherently undesirable. Critics  argued moreover that the concept distracted from  the more urgent priority of mitigating human green - house gas emissions. They claimed that focusing on  resilience encouraged the assumption that disasters  are inevitable  — naturalizing sources of vulnerability  in marginalized populations  — and that it displaced re - sponsibility for avoiding disaster from governments  to individuals.8 Yet people of the past plainly found ways to cope  with climate changes, and there is no term as accessi - ble as resilience to describe their achievements. Nor SPOTLIGHT 1.1 Beyond crisis and collapse:  Climate change in human history Dagomar Degroot,  Georgetown University 51 CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX is there any doubt that governments must foster re - silience to the human-caused warming that is already  baked into the current climate crisis. Today, the Inter - governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) uses  the term resilience to mean the ability of coupled  human and natural systems “to cope with a hazardous  event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorgan - izing in ways that maintain their essential function,  identity and structure.”9 It therefore encompasses  adaptation, which the IPCC defines as the “process  of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its ef - fects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial  opportunities.”10 Neither adaptation nor resilience is  automatically a positive quality. Both may preserve  unjust systems and come at the expense of vulnerable  populations. In particular, the resilience of a society,  government, institution or culture across decades or  centuries may belie the vulnerability of ordinary peo - ple to extreme weather.11 Scholars in different disciplines have attempted to  identify historical examples of resilience in diverse  ways. Archaeologists, for example, have perhaps  overstressed “adaptionist” understandings of past  responses to climate change. Many have defined re - silience using resilience theory, a method based on  the adaptive cycle model, in which social-ecological  systems gradually lose resilience as they grow in size  and complexity, then regain it after they collapse.  Yet today there is widespread disagreement over  how  — and whether  — to use resilience theory. Inter - disciplinary collaborations therefore typically use  broad conceptualizations of resilience, most of which  roughly align with the IPCC’s definition.12 One recent approach is to identify common path - ways followed by populations that were broadly re - silient in the face of past climate changes  — meaning  that they avoided serious or sustained demographic  loss. This approach can emphasize both the diversi - ty of resilient responses to past climate changes and  the existence of shared strategies that may inform  present-day climate policy.13 There are at least five of  these pathways (figure S1.1.1): • Identifying new opportunities in local and regional  environments. • Maintaining or developing resilient energy systems. • Exploiting diverse resources through trade. • Adapting institutions to new climatic risks. • Migrating to new environments.Populations that followed the first pathway ex - ploited regional or local environments that respond - ed to global or hemispheric climate changes in ways  that benefitted how these populations had organ - ized their societies. The most striking examples  date back to the Pleistocene, the geological epoch  in which cycles in Earth’s orbit and rotation repeat - edly altered greenhouse gas concentrations enough  to trigger alternating glacial and interglacial peri - ods. In glacial periods advancing ice sheets trapped  water previously in the oceans, lowering sea levels  and creating land bridges that humans exploited to  migrate across the Earth. The same forces responsi - ble for glacial and interglacial periods also strength - ened monsoon systems, periodically “greening” the  Sahara and helping pastoralists migrate through and  thrive in what is now the world’s largest desert. Pas - toralists, in turn, may have delayed the redesertifi - cation of parts of the Sahara by sustaining healthy  grassland ecosystems.14 Well into the Holocene, the recent geological  epoch characterized by a relatively stable intergla - cial climate, similar dynamics played out across  smaller scales in time and space. In the Eastern Med - iterranean precipitation increased during winter, the  region’s wet season, during the 6th century CE. Pas - toral and agricultural communities benefitted from  higher rainfall because the taxation system of the  Eastern Mediterranean allowed them to easily trans - port agricultural commodities to population centres.  Rising productivity encouraged elites to invest in  market-oriented agriculture; new dams, channels,  pools and other infrastructure then allowed farmers  to manage water more effectively.15 The second pathway involved developing or ex - ploiting energy systems for transportation, industry  and human subsistence that did not respond directly  to shifts in temperature or precipitation. As Europe - an temperatures declined in the 6th century, com - munities in Frisia (in today’s northern Netherlands)  thrived by consuming dairy and meat from livestock,  supplemented by fish, shellfish and waterfowl. This  subsistence strategy was less sensitive to cooling than  others in Europe, many of which depended on culti - vating grains that were sensitive to variations in tem - perature.16 In the same century subsistence strategies  across much of Finland and in northern Sweden and  Norway did not depend on crop cultivation and in  52 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 fact primarily exploited wild food resources such as  birds, freshwater fish, seals and terrestrial mammals.  Changes in temperature affected the availability and  accessibility of these resources in diverse ways.17 In Kraków, Poland, firewood prices rose as win - ter temperatures declined in the 17th, 18th and 19th  centuries. Because the city occupied an increasingly  peripheral position within larger polities, state au - thorities did not act to relieve high fuel prices. The  city’s inhabitants therefore shifted decisively from  wood to coal for heating. Coal was more reliable and  less expensive than firewood  — and therefore benefi - cial for household budgets.18To follow the third pathway, populations exploited  the benefits of trade  — including trade within imperial  borders  — to cope with climate change. Weather rarely  affected far-flung regions simultaneously or equally.  Trade therefore allowed populations to thrive despite  climatic anomalies by importing commodities that  were less available locally, owing in part to extreme  weather. The integration of European and then glob - al grain markets in the 2nd millennium CE eventually  buffered populations at the centre of trading networks  from increases in food prices that were influenced by  precipitation or temperature anomalies.19 At the same  time these networks could render populations on Figure S1.1.1 The five pathways to resilience A means of building resilience  by adjusting to actual or  expected climate and its eﬀects  in order to moderate harm or  exploit beneﬁcial opportunitiesThe ability of societies to cope  with a hazardous event, trend  or disturbance, responding or  reorganizing in ways that  maintain their essential  function, identity and structure Exploiting  new  opportunitiesResilient  energy  systemResources  of trade  and empirePolitical and institutional  adaptationsMigration  and  transformation Resilience AdaptationCLIMATE PRESSURES Note: The definition of resilience and adaptation are based on IPCC (2022a).

In the late 19th century millions died when econom - ic and political priorities led British governments to  demand grain exports from colonized India, despite  local droughts.20 Some populations coped with climatic variability  and change by inventing technologies and exploit - ing commodities that opened new possibilities for  trade. When droughts and periods of high precipi - tation alternated in southeastern California in the  15th century, Mojava settlements developed new ce - ramic technologies and basket-making techniques  to establish trade networks centred on maize, beans  and squash produced by nearby Kwatsáan communi - ties.21 These networks fostered the expansion of a dy - namic “dream culture” that further elevated Mojave  long-distance trading. Dreams that successfully di - rected Mojaves towards prosperity or military victory  rewarded leaders with political power, while dreams  that resulted in failure undermined the individual  leaders who shared them. The result was a more mo - bile, seasonally oriented and interregional economy  that could better cope with climatic variability.22 The fourth pathway involved deliberate political  and institutional adaptations that fostered resilience  to weather extremes. Italian city-states responded  to agricultural disruptions worsened by 13th century  cooling by securing new food imports, setting restric - tions on grain prices, providing grain subsidies and  banning grain exports. Cooling across Europe in the  final decades of the 17th century reduced grain yields  and tax revenues across France just as grain supplies  were already strained by military provisions. French  administrators struggled to respond effectively, and  harvest failures in 1693 and 1694 led to catastroph - ic famines.23 When similar conditions returned in  1709, however, administrators negotiated emergency  grain imports from Algeria that effectively eased food  shortages.24 Finally, populations took the fifth pathway by mi - grating to either escape or exploit the impacts of cli - mate change in local environments. Climate refugees  migrating to escape the desertification of the east - ern Sahara likely helped establish Pharaonic Egypt.25  Across Eurasia, pastoral societies later threatened  agrarian empires when precipitation changes ei - ther allowed them to rear more horses or threatened  grasslands that otherwise sustained them. Some migrations by pastoralists responded to subsistence  crises  — and thus political and military vulnerability  —  within agrarian empires. Jurchen raids, for instance,  exploited destabilizing droughts in 17th century  China to establish the Qing Dynasty.26 Populations often pursued multiple pathways at  the same time, and different communities in soci - eties could follow distinct pathways. Populations  may also have benefitted from additional pathways  to endure or exploit climate changes. For example,  resilient populations may have enjoyed low socio - economic inequality or effective means of providing  life’s necessities for their poorest members. A robust  culture of civic charity in Dutch coastal cities helped  insulate the 16th and 17th century Dutch Repub - lic from famines that affected primarily poor people  in other parts of Europe.27 Similarly, the population  of Tokugawa Japan soared during periods of severe  17th century cooling partly because wealthy farm - ers were expected to provide for poor people.28 Ad - ditional pathways may have been adaptive for some  communities but maladaptive for others. Capital-in - tensive hydraulic infrastructure likely increased the  vulnerability to drought of polities in South America,  Egypt, Mesopotamia and Cambodia, all of which de - pended on canals for irrigation, but provided drain - age and transportation opportunities in coastal areas  of the present-day Netherlands and thereby stimu - lated the development of greater wealth and military  potential.29 What, then, can policymakers learn from the di - verse experiences of climate change in the past to  build resilience to today’s human-caused warming?  One lesson may be that the impacts of climate change  on populations were and are determined as much by  human socioeconomic, cultural and political arrange - ments as the magnitude of environmental transfor - mations. Communities, therefore, are rarely doomed  to a particular fate; under all but the most extreme  emissions scenarios, substantial scope remains for  human adaptation and prosperity. More specifically, the past reveals that adaptations  to build resilience may involve identifying and ex - ploiting what rare opportunities warming may pro - vide, developing energy systems that both mitigate  emissions and are resilient to extreme weather, diver - sifying sources of energy and commodities, restoring  or maintaining flexible political and legal systems  54 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 NOTES 1 Osman and others 2021; Tierney and others 2020. 2 Degroot and others 2021. 3 See, for example, Brooke (2015) and Weiss (2017). 4 See, for instance, Campbell (2016) and Parker (2013). 5 See, for example, Begley (2021). 6 IPCC 2021. 7 Degroot and others 2021. 8 Soens 2020. 9 IPCC 2022a. 10 IPCC 2022a. 11 Izdebski, Mordechai and White 2018; Soens 2018; Van Bavel and others  2020. 12 Bradtmöller, Grimm and Riel-Salvatore 2017; Riede 2008. 13 Degroot and others 2021. 14 Brierley, Manning and Maslin 2018; Claussen, Dallmeyer and Bader 2017;  Timmermann and Friedrich 2016. 15 Decker 2009; Izdebski and others 2016.16 Devroey 2003; Knol and Ijssennagger 2017; Vos 2015. 17 Oinonen and others 2020; Tvauri 2014. 18 Miodunka 2020. 19 Epstein 2006. 20 Davis 2002. 21 Anderson 2005. 22 Zappia 2014. 23 Berger 1976; Lachvier 1991; Campbell and others 2017; Guillet and others  2017; Lavigne and others 2013. 24 Goubert 1982. 25 Lieberman and Gordon 2018. 26 Brook 2010; Cui and others 2019. 27 Curtis and Dijkman 2019. 28 Parker 2013. 29 Buckley and others 2010; Degroot 2018; de Souza and others 2019; Gill  2000; Manning and others 2017.that prioritize redundancies over efficiencies and nor - malizing climate migration. The past may also reveal  that tackling inequality and poverty  — in particular,  through policies that further environmental justice  for historically marginalized populations  — will foster  resilience to global warming. And it may indicate that capital-intensive interventions to adapt to climate  change have the potential to become sources of vul - nerability. More HCS scholarship will further clarify  the lessons of the past, lessons that may offer compel - ling reasons for hope and suggest strategies for sus - tainable human development in the decades to come. CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 55 When Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer coined  the term Anthropocene in 2000 to denote an epoch  characterized by the geological impact of the human  species on planet Earth, these effects were already  evident.1 Since then, geologists and other scientists  have debated the starting point of the Anthropo - cene. Among the contenders is the dispersion of ra - dioactive isotopes from widespread nuclear testing  during the 1950s  — an indicator also singled out by  the Anthropocene Working Group under the Inter - national Commission on Stratigraphy.2 Meanwhile,  the Anthropocene has become both a ubiquitous  scientific concept and a potent political symbol that  extends to the Earth’s climate and ecosystems. As  a result, questions of extinction and survival loom  large in political debates about human development  in this new epoch. Such debates echo those around  the Cold War nuclear arms race, and there are good  reasons for scrutinizing the intellectual and political  links between the nuclear age and the current predic - ament. Indeed, a closer examination of the nuclear–   environment nexus offers a prescient perspective on  the persistent links between militarization and an - thropogenic reconfigurations of the planet. Historically, the connections between nuclear  weapons and the environment are both multiple and  deep. That nature could be controlled and manipulat - ed was an integral part of the notion of security dur - ing the Cold War. The postwar development of such  scientific disciplines as meteorology, glaciology and  oceanography took place in a close relationship with  the preparations for nuclear war, since adequate un - derstanding of the effects of these weapons  — vital  for strategy and defence  — depended on ecologi - cal knowledge. Over time these branches of science  produced a new understanding of the Earth and its  interacting systems, which in turn fostered concep - tions of security as common and tied to the natural  environment.Nuclear testing and uncertainties about the effects  of radioactive fallout gave rise to scientific measure - ments and environmental concerns, entanglements  that persist to this day in climate modelling.3 Anti - nuclear activists and movements unrelentingly criti - cized the arms race and the attendant risks of nuclear  deterrence while exploiting scientific uncertainty  and disagreement to expand political responsibility  in time and space. Temporally, the effects of nucle - ar weapons revolved around future generations. And  spatially, the effects transgressed any ground zero  and came to include concern for both humanity and  the planet, later symbolized in iconic photos of a liv - ing yet fragile Earth taken from space. The nuclear  arms race paradoxically sparked a more ecocentric  conception of the environment.4 The 1980s, when détente had given way to the  second Cold War, witnessed an intensification and  emerging synthesis of such links, especially striking  in the work of Jonathan Schell, author of the best - selling The Fate of the Earth  (1982).5 The book, which  compels people to imagine the extinction of the  human species as a way of cultivating a global eco - logical awareness that included the fate of future gen - erations, played a central role in the “nuclear freeze”  movement and primed the public for debates about  nuclear winter. Drawing on the latest insights from  Earth system science, Schell concluded that the en - vironmental effects of nuclear war would most likely  leave Earth uninhabitable for humans. The political  lesson taught by science was clear: the survival of  the human species depended on functioning Earth  systems and had to be seen in a broader ecological  framework. To Schell, nuclear weapons symbolized  not only modernity’s inability to recognize its own  self-destructiveness but also a hubris in humans’  belief that the threat to complex, fragile and highly  interdependent ecosystems could be rationally man - aged and contained.6SPOTLIGHT 1.2 The nuclear–environment nexus and human  development in the Anthropocene Rens van Munster,  Danish Institute for International Studies, and Casper Sylvest,  University of Southern Denmark,  Department of History 56 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 After the turn of the millennium, Schell’s under - standing of the entanglements between nuclear  weapons and climate issues led him to recognize the  value of the Anthropocene as an idea that explicitly  foregrounds the connections between Western mo - dernity and human technological prowess on the  one hand and climate change, species extinction and  biodiversity loss on the other. To Schell the Anthro - pocene called for reflecting more deeply on human– Earth relations and expanding the conventional  horizons of space, time, community and agency. Yet,  valuing ourselves as humans in relation to nature and  other forms of life involves a heavy ethical and po - litical responsibility, and Schell clearly feared that  humans were not up to the task at a time when their  technological power forcefully set the species apart  from the rest of creation. Ultimately, however, Schell  insisted on the role of human beings as “chief valuer”  and maintained that a true embrace of this responsi - bility would decentre the human, whether by install - ing sober lessons about humility, prudence and the  limits of a narrow technological rationality or by pro - moting more ecocentric valuations of the world, as expressed in ideas about interspecies entanglements,  companionship and “nature-based” solutions to cli - mate change.7 Schell’s work is a reminder of the deep relation - ship between nuclear weapons and the environment  in the Anthropocene. Nuclear weapons are detri - mental to human development and risk jeopardiz - ing the ecological systems on which it depends. The  vast economic resources required for the produc - tion, maintenance and stockpiling of nuclear weap - ons divert funds away from human development  and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.  Nuclear war would also have grave humanitarian  consequences, including large-scale displacements,  long-term harm to human health, restricted access to  food and catastrophic damage to the environment.  Some scientists predict that even a limited nuclear  war could set off a global nuclear winter.8 In a nucle - ar-armed world survivability and sustainability are  tightly entwined.

CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 57 Humanity has faced many natural existential risks  over the 3,000 centuries we have survived so far  —  such as risks from asteroid impacts or supervolcanic  eruptions. But the anthropogenic risks we now face  appear much greater in probability and continue to  rise as our power over the world grows ever greater.1  It is unclear whether we can survive another three  centuries, let alone three thousand. To survive, we need to achieve two things. We must  first bring the current level of existential risk down  —  putting out the fires we already face from the threat  of nuclear war and climate change. But we cannot al - ways be fighting fires. A defining feature of existen - tial risk is that there are no second chances  — a single  existential catastrophe would be our permanent un - doing. So we must also create the equivalent of fire  brigades and fire-safety codes  — making institutional  changes to ensure that existential risk (including that  from new technologies and developments) stays low  forever. If we can achieve both these things, we will have  reached existential security: a return to comparative  safety, where we have ended the era of heightened  risk to humanity.2 This would be no utopia. Existen - tial security would not guarantee universal human  development or freedom  — or health and prosperi - ty. But it would be necessary to achieve any of those  things  — a foundation on which they rest. One way to look at our current position is that hu - manity faces a high and unsustainable level of risk.  Indeed, we can see this as one of the most fundamen - tal kinds of sustainability. Think of the probability  that humanity will continue to survive and flourish  over a time span comparable with the 3,000 centu - ries we have lived so far. Each year that our time of  heightened risk goes on, this probability of a success - ful future drops. And nothing we ever do could restore  that chance. The probability of humanity surviving to  live out its potential is the ultimate nonrenewable re - source: something we depend on completely  — with no possible substitutes  — but are frittering away. Exis - tential security means stabilizing humanity’s survival  curve  — greatly reducing the risk and ensuring that it  stays low. Only by doing so can we keep the probabili - ty of long-term survival high (figure S1.3.1). What would be required to stem this loss  — to reach  existential security? A large part of the answer has to come from inter - national institutions. Existential security is inher - ently international: the risks that could destroy us  transcend national boundaries, and finding ways  forward that never once succumb to an existential  catastrophe will require international coordination.  Meeting this challenge would be an extremely diffi - cult but necessary task. Here are some broad outlines  of what it would require. As Carl Sagan wrote: “The world-altering powers  that technology has delivered into our hands now re - quire a degree of consideration and foresight that has  never before been asked of us.”3 We need the fore - sight to see the risks while they are still on the hori - zon, providing time to steer around them or, if that  is impossible, to prepare to meet them. This involves  knowing how to ask the right questions about future  dangers. And while being able to accurately answer  such questions is impossible, great progress is being  made in systematically assigning well-calibrated and  accurate probabilities to them.4 An institution aimed  at existential security would need to harness this pro - gress and be at the forefront of forecasting expertise. It would also require extremely high trust: from  both the public and the elites across many different  nation states. Perhaps it could learn from the Inter - governmental Panel on Climate Change, with its  attempts to neutrally establish the current state of  scientific consensus on climate change in a transpar - ent manner, with input from all nations. An institution for existential security would need  extremely strong coordinating ability. Because exis - tential risk threatens a common foundation on which SPOTLIGHT 1.3 What kind of institution is needed for existential security? Toby Ord,  Senior Research Fellow, The Future of Humanity Institute, University of Oxford, United Kingdom 58 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 all of our varied hopes and futures are built, it is in  every nation’s interest to avoid it. But because differ - ent strategies and tactics for avoiding risk will have  burdens that fall unevenly upon the nations, there are  still great challenges for coordinating a path forward  that everyone can accept. Finally, such an institution would require a great  deal of buy-in. This would have to be both strong and  lasting. Strong buy-in would be required before the idea of  an institution to govern existential risks could even  get off the ground, as nations will not lightly make  the sacrifices in sovereignty that would be required.  While there is not sufficient buy-in at the moment,  this may change over years or decades as people  slowly face up to the gravity of the threats facing hu - manity. And just as the United Nations was formed  in the wake of the crisis and catastrophe of the Sec - ond World War, in the wake of new global crises and threats, the idea of new institutions with the power to  achieve existential security may move quickly from  unthinkable to inevitable. Our resolve would have to be lasting. National  constitutions provide proof that building institution - al constraints that last hundreds of years is possible.  Designing a constitution means setting in place the  parameters for our descendants to operate across  generations  — as well as the means to adjust those  parameters if circumstances change in unforeseen  ways. Building institutions to reach existential secu - rity would have much in common with formulating a  constitution  — not just for a nation, but for humanity,  and with a focus on ensuring that each generation co - operates to give succeeding generations the chance  the exist and flourish in their turn.

CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 59 People–planet interactions underpin many of the di - verse capacities required to embrace uncertainty, to  navigate and respond to the complex dynamics of the  Anthropocene. The diversity of life on Earth and all  the myriad functions, connections and interactions  we have with it provides short-term and long-term ca - pacity for life (including human life) to persist under  and adapt to sudden and gradual changes of the An - thropocene. As dominant models of development  —  with their emphasis on industrialization, resource  exploitation and urbanization  — continue to erode  biodiversity and human interactions with it, we  lose options and opportunities, reducing flexibili - ty and adaptive capacity. Worryingly, these declines  further push other planetary pressures such as cli - mate change and pollution ever closer to dangerous  thresholds.1 A focus on human–nature relationships and trans - formative capacities moves away from the risk reduc - tion approaches that have become dominant as ways  to manage uncertainty but that often fail to address  the complex causes of planetary pressures and ine - quality.2 Instead, by foregrounding on relationships,  policy can overcome problematic divisions between  nature and development to focus on the quality of  relationships connecting people and planet and on  reconfiguring relationships to enhance capacities to  navigate uncertain futures.3 For example, new indica - tors emerging from indigenous community monitor - ing systems feature relationships connecting people  and nature, such as indicators of the condition of  the human–biodiversity relationship4 and indicators  that monitor relationships and feedbacks between  the social and ecological components of a place.5  Such monitoring systems do not treat the social and  ecological parts as separable. They focus instead on  what connects them and could prove a valuable way  forward for more integrated approaches to assessing  human development progress.Recognizing people–planet relationships widens  the focus of policy from the local level to take into ac - count the globally intertwined social-ecological sys - tems of the Anthropocene. An increase in planetary  pressures in one part of the world ripples across re - gions, with material and other less tangible impacts  on distant places and groups, as the Covid-19 pan - demic has so graphically highlighted. The Anthro - pocene is a heightened state of interconnectedness  where social-ecological teleconnections and power  asymmetries in global systems require new forms of  solidarity for the interdependencies and realities of  the Anthropocene.6 Transitions in one country from  nonrenewable energy sources (fossil fuels) towards  renewable energy (solar) — done in solidarity with  groups and places where the mineral resources (co - balt or lithium) for these technologies reside  — will  likely have very different outcomes for human devel - opment from local transitions that do not account for  such distant impacts and dynamics.7 Inclusion and participation, so central to the human  development journey, can also have blind spots. Fo - cusing on people–planet relationships highlights ad - ditional barriers and potentially new dimensions of  inclusiveness. It opens avenues to explore moral or  ethical questions around including nonhuman enti - ties and the risks and impacts imposed on those en - tities through various policy choices. This expansion  of care and concern in human development is a lively  topic receiving increasing attention as the intercon - nection and impact of our relationship with the natu - ral world becomes more apparent.8 It is strengthened  as development policy engages more deeply with  multiple knowledge and value systems that reject the  separation of human and nonhuman or of nature and  people. Biocultural approaches, for example, portray  human livelihoods, landscapes and ecosystems  as having coevolved over long periods of time. SPOTLIGHT 1.4 People–planet relationships in an  uncertain, unsettled world Belinda Reyers,  University of Pretoria and Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics of the Royal Swedish Academy  of Sciences 60 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 Biocultural diversity is the “diversity of life in all its  manifestations  — biological, cultural, and linguistic   — which are interrelated within a complex socio - ecological adaptive system.”9 Taking into account the dynamics of the Anthropo - cene, where complex social-ecological interactions  result in lag effects and where today’s choices are  committing the planet to global-scale changes that  will span thousands of years,10 it becomes apparent  that inclusion and participation have an important  temporal dimension and that policy must innovate  to include young people and consider future gener - ations whose realities are being shaped for the long  term by actions and choices taken today. Innovation and human development have long  gone hand in hand. In the context of the Anthropo - cene, there is, however, a risk that many of the in - novative policies, practices and interventions that  exist and are emerging will all stay small, localized  and short term  — tinkering at the edges without fun - damentally rewiring development models and ap - proaches to truly contend with the Anthropocene,  the scale of its planetary pressures and the economic  and political systems and asymmetries on which it is  based.11 Innovations that do not consider what needs  to be built up and broken down, what needs protec - tion and how to manage power asymmetries and par - ticipation can end up increasing vulnerability and  eroding sustainability and resilience.12 Substituting one innovation (such as fossil fuel)  with another (such as renewable energy) without ad - dressing justice and sustainability of the transition  will reduce emissions but will also likely defer many other impacts and risks to another place, group and  time, without necessarily improving energy access  and democracy.13 As the 2020 Human Development  Report made clear: “We must reorient our approach  from solving discrete siloed problems to navigating  multidimensional, interconnected and increasingly  universal predicaments.”14 By anchoring innovation  in deliberate considerations of people–planet rela - tionships, the interconnections and interdependen - cies become clear and offer novel opportunities for  human development in an uncertain future.15 These  interdependencies are not only material flows of en - ergy, resources and waste; they are also intangible  but essential in how they shape identities, cultures,  relationships, minds, mental and physical wellbeing,  and ultimately freedoms and choices in ways we  often realize only when lost.16 Without acknowledging these relationships in the  human development journey, dangerous feedbacks  and negative people–planet relationships will under - mine human development gains.17 Previous inno - vations that have ignored these relationships to the  detriment of the environment, vulnerable groups,  local adaptive capacities and cultural practices are  legion.18 On the other hand, research exploring per - sistent poverty traps that considers social-ecological  interactions highlights not only important causes of  these traps but also novel pathways out of poverty.19  As Michele-Lee Moore and colleagues point out, it  is “the capacity to see, interrogate, and reimagine”  these people–planet relationships that will create the  disruptive and radical changes needed for transfor - mations to sustainability.20 NOTES 1 Mace and others 2014; Steffen and others 2015. 2 Reyers and others 2022. 3 Haider and others 2021. 4 Lyver and others 2017. 5 Thompson and others 2020. 6 Rocha, Peterson and Biggs 2015. 7 Lèbre and others 2020. 8 Díaz and others 2019; Lee 2020. 9 Maffi 2005, p. 602. 10 Keys and others 2019.11 Eriksen and others 2021; Hooli 2016. 12 Olsson and others 2017. 13 Lèbre and others 2020. 14 UNDP 2020b, p 5. 15 Moore and others 2014. 16 Njwambe, Cocks and Vetter 2019. 17 Olsson and others 2017 18 Haider and others 2021. 19 Lade and others 2017. 20 Moore and others 2018, p. 38.

They encourage innovation, rein - force social connections and build trust in others and  in institutions.1 Worry and anxiety about the future  have negative health outcomes, ranging from mental  health problems to heart disease and increased risk  of obesity, including among children.2 Pervasive eco - nomic insecurity generates popular discontent and  imperils political stability. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, many peo - ple found themselves and their families on shaky  economic ground. Growing employment instability  and work that is increasingly precarious and poorly  paid, together with persistent joblessness, are root  causes of rising economic insecurity in high-income  countries. In low- and middle-income countries high  informal employment continues to affect income  stability. People can no longer rely on stable, decent  work to provide economic stability throughout their  lives  — a trend compounded by the Covid-19 pandem - ic and an emerging climate crisis. Increased awareness of climate change and its  many implications has injected growing uncertainty  about the future and raised people’s concerns about  their wellbeing in the long run. Even though the ef - fects are shaping anxieties worldwide, the impacts  will be uneven. People in the poorest countries, par - ticularly children and young people, stand to lose the  most. Indeed, people in poverty are more exposed to ad - verse events, from ill health to the growing impacts  of systemic shocks such as climate change and pan - demics, and have fewer resources to cope with and  recover from their consequences. However, many  people who are not poor by national or international  standards are or feel economically insecure as well.  In fact, while economic security and confidence in  the future have traditionally been defining features of the middle class, this group is feeling increasing - ly insecure.3 Workers in the informal economy and  the growing number of people under nonstandard  contractual arrangements are highly insecure, as are  people with lower education levels, women, younger  adults, members of racial and ethnic minorities and  heads of single-parent households.4 Despite its significance, growing economic in - security has stayed under the policy radar in many  countries. Experts find fault in the fact that it is not  adequately reflected in standard national statistics.5  Indeed, many measurement issues related to inse - curity are still unresolved, and empirical research on  developing countries is scarce. Whatever the method used to assess economic  risks, the implications of these risks depend crucial - ly on the buffers available. Catastrophic expenses  and large debts drive falls into poverty when social  protection systems do not help guard against risks or  cover their effects. Even in developed countries with  comprehensive social protection systems, compara - tive cross-country data suggest that public transfers  protect only about 40 percent of adults against large  drops in disposable income (drops of 25 percent of  disposable income or above).6 Not only are risks growing, but policies are also  not keeping up with current trends. Public institu - tions, policies and governance systems are struggling  to adapt to rapidly changing needs across  countries.  Social protection coverage is often contingent on a  traditional formal employer–employee relationship,  and many schemes are not portable across jobs. La - bour market institutions and regulations are also  challenged by the growing diversification of working  arrangements. There are, however, policy innovations in both de - veloped and developing countries that demonstrate  the capacity of social protection systems, labour  market institutions and public services to adapt to  changing circumstances. These include new forms SPOTLIGHT 1.5 On economic insecurity Jonathan Perry, Marta Roig and Maren Jiménez,  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs 62 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 of social protection that adequately cover informal  workers, migrant workers or those with nonstandard  contracts.7 There are also agile programmes that au - tomatically scale up in response to systemic shocks,  such as pandemics or climate-related emergencies.  Some groups of informal workers have pursued  new models of collective representation to protect  their interests, namely through cooperatives, self- help groups and associations. Some of these new  organizations have helped workers connect and un - dertake collective action, but many lack the legal  capacity to negotiate working conditions. A key  challenge for these organizations is that many in - formal workers are not considered workers under  the law and therefore do not have bargaining rights.  In some countries  — Canada, Germany and Swe - den, for instance  — collective bargaining rights have  been extended to some categories of self-employed  workers.8 Providing economic security remains a key role  of the state and its institutions and is a foundation  of the social contract between government and citi - zens. Many governments spend a substantial share  of GDP to safeguard against hardship-causing loss - es, through social protection systems, healthcare and  other public services. This is a crucial moment to re - flect on how to adapt past policies and institutions to  a new socioeconomic reality. Large-scale crises heighten risk and insecurity and  have, at times, opened a path to renew the social con - tract. The unprecedented income support and health  measures put in place by many governments as a re - sponse to the Covid-19 pandemic attest to the prima - ry role that the state continues to play in confronting  economic risk and insecurity. Policy responses to  the crisis have ranged from direct payroll support  to employers to covering income losses in informal employment to rent payments and eviction moratori - ums, not to mention expanding healthcare coverage  in traditionally underserved areas.9 However, many of these measures are temporary.  Most of them leave beneficiaries just as vulnerable  to future shocks once they are removed. Compre - hensive, universal social protection systems, when  in place, play a much more durable role in protecting  workers and in reducing the prevalence of poverty  than short-term, ad hoc measures, since they act as  automatic stabilizers. They provide basic income se - curity at all times and therefore enhance people’s ca - pacity to manage and overcome shocks. Countries with social protection systems already  in place were able to scale them up quickly during  the Covid-19 pandemic. Investments in building and  expanding social protection systems in some Latin  American countries over the past decades have cush - ioned the fallout from the crisis, at least in the short  term.10 Many other low- and middle-income coun - tries entered the crisis on weak financial footing,  however. Their ability to expand social protection  has been constrained by lack of fiscal space as well as  by a lack of existing mechanisms on which to build.  Overall, the financial support to individuals and fam - ilies has varied dramatically across countries, as has  access to vaccines and thus the speed of econom - ic recovery. Without urgent corrective action from  the international community, the current crisis is  likely to widen disparities both within and between  countries.11 Focusing on the challenges people face today  —  from increasingly precarious employment to inad - equate healthcare and difficulty accessing social  protection, housing and other public services  — can  narrow social, economic and political divides and  guard against the next global crisis.

CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 63 Humanity has entered a new era of risk created by  the confluence of twin crises  — one rooted in the  darkening global security horizon, the other stem - ming from ongoing environmental destruction. The  risks are complex and often unpredictable. While  failing to address either crisis adequately, govern - ments are not paying enough attention to the cross - over points where the most dangerous situations are  emerging. There are more hungry and displaced people than  a decade ago,1 twice as many state-based conflicts  and twice as many deaths in those conflicts.2 Govern - ments are spending more on their military forces.3  Even before the war in Ukraine, nuclear states were  increasing the number of warheads being held in  readiness for use.4 Meanwhile, the impacts of climate  change are worsening,5 plastic pollution and resource  depletion continue almost unabated and the health of  ecosystems declines. Half a century ago, at the United Nations Con - ference on the Human Environment in Stockholm,  governments formally recognized that ecological  integrity is essential to human development.6 Now,  the consequences of declining ecological integrity  are clear. The countries facing the greatest ecologi - cal threat are statistically likely to be among the least  peaceful. They also tend to be marked by fragility and  low capacity for resilience.7 Half of ongoing UN peace  operations are in the countries with the highest expo - sure to climate change impacts.8 A climate change impact or the disappearance of  an important food resource does not axiomatical - ly cause insecurity and conflict, but it does increase  the risk.9 The risk will be heightened if the society in  question is already tense, fragile or insecure and will  be lower if it is well-governed and well-resourced  (box S1.6.1). Additionally, insecurity can lead to peo - ple taking decisions that damage environmental  integrity.To succeed, transitions must be just and peaceful Turning back the tide of environmental decline is  necessary in order to reduce the risks and secure an  environment of peace. It will entail major transitions  in such sectors as energy, industry and land use.10  Transitions need to occur quickly and successfully.  However, interventions aiming to tackle an environ - mental problem can exacerbate insecurity or cause a  different form of environmental damage. In the 2000s the rush to biofuels led to landgrabs  in the Global South as producers looked to meet de - mand stimulated by policy choices in the Global  North. This contributed to soaring food prices and  resultant unrest in countries such as Burkina Faso,  Egypt and Haiti.11 Building hydropower dams has altogether dis - placed an estimated 80 million people on every in - habited continent.12 In Myanmar dam building has  forced displaced people into areas populated by other  ethnic groups, leading to clashes.13 Once in place,  dams restrict water availability for downstream use,  disrupt biodiversity and fish stocks important for  food, flood farmland and divide communities. Meeting the Paris Agreement 1.5°C target could  entail a 10-fold expansion of hydropower in Afri - ca.14 Governments and companies such as airlines  propose increased biofuel production.15 Unless a dif - ferent approach is taken, conflict and displacement  could result again. With the sixth mass extinction of species in Earth’s  history possibly under way, attempts to protect na - ture and biodiversity are at a crunch point. More than  90 governments now support the goal of protecting  30 percent of the Earth’s surface through conserva - tion by 2030, the so-called 30×30 initiative,16 which is  up for negotiation at the 2022 UN Convention on Bi - ological Diversity summit.17 However, with 300 mil- lion people living in key biodiversity areas, 30×30 has SPOTLIGHT 1.6 Building an environment of peace in a new era of risk Environment of Peace Initiative,  Stockholm International Peace Research Institute 64 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 provoked concern over land rights, indigenous peo - ples’ rights and food security.18 Two UN Special Rap - porteurs have warned of “fortress conservation.”19 Wind and solar power, set to become the main en - ergy sources in a rapidly decarbonizing world, have  historically generated very little conflict. However,  there are potential issues at both ends of the product  lifecycle, as there are with batteries for energy stor - age and electric vehicles. At the source end, concerns  focus on the human rights abuses connected with  some mining operations for minerals such as lithium,  cobalt and rare earth elements.20 At the disposal end,  wind turbines, solar panels and batteries need to be  made fully recyclable, to avoid the creation of poten - tially huge waste streams.21 The urgency of the crisis in nature and climate  change is so acute that rapid and profound transitions  are needed to halt and reverse it. Failure to do so will  inevitably lead to further security risks associated  with continuously rising impacts. However, failure to enact transitions in a fair and peaceful manner will be  a sure-fire recipe for both creating further insecurity  and conflict risks and compromising the prospects of  success. Beginnings of a new security Despite the gravity of the global situation, there are  hopeful signs from community projects up to the su - pranational institution level. Recognition within the United Nations of the rela - tionship between environmental degradation and se - curity dates back to at least January 1992, when the  Security Council declared that “non-military sources  of instability in the economic, social, humanitarian  and ecological fields have become threats to peace  and security.”22 The link has since been acknowl - edged in many other declarations and initiatives, in - cluding the Sustainable Development Goals and the Box S1.6.1 Haiti’s systemic shock Environment of Peace Initiative,  Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Haiti, the lowest income country in the Americas, has been beset by decades of political instability, natural hazards (in - cluding a massive earthquake in the Southern Peninsula of the country in 2010) and removal of tree cover, in turn leav - ing communities exposed to storms and landslides.1 In January 2020 the Haitian Parliament dissolved after elections  were postponed, with President Jovenel Moïse attempting to rule by decree against a backdrop of continuing public  unrest.2 Two months later Haiti reported its first cases of Covid-19. The government declared a health emergency, with  a familiar mix of school and business closures, limitations on transport and gatherings, and a night-time curfew.3 With three-fifths of the population already below the poverty line and antigovernment sentiment running high,4  people refused to abide by the regulations, boosting the infection rate.5 Agricultural production fell, and food prices  rose by more than 25 percent.6 In August tropical storm Laura came to Haiti, ruining 50–80 percent of certain crops  in the southeast.7 Unusually dry months followed, depressing harvests by up to 80 percent. Entering 2021, food prices  were running 40 percent above normal.8 In May 2021, with Covid-19 cases soaring, the government redeclared a state of emergency.9 In July tropical storm  Elsa hit the same southeast regions devastated by Laura the previous year.10 Four days later, for reasons that remain  unclear, gunmen assassinated President Moïse, unleashing a further period of political turmoil.11 Soon afterward, the  United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization declared that nearly half the Haitian population was in acute food  insecurity.12 Perhaps a country with stable politics could have coped with the two storms in quick succession. Perhaps without  the restrictions around Covid-19, political order could have been restored. But the combination of the previous de - cades of environmental destruction and political turmoil, unrest in the streets, Covid-19 and two major storms dealt  Haiti a systemic blow. Millions have been left without sufficient food or prospects, the only certainty being that more  insecurity lies ahead.

CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 65 Sustaining Peace initiative.23 Nevertheless, security  and environmental agendas have largely progressed  along separate tracks. The creation of the Climate Se - curity Mechanism in 2018 has built a bridge, but the  serial vetoing of resolutions on climate change and  security within the Security Council is one bar to full - er coordination. Several regional blocs also acknowledge the links  between environmental degradation and security, in - cluding the African Union, the European Union, the  Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Eu - rope and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.  The African Union recognizes that addressing human  impacts on the planet, such as climate change, will re - duce the risk of conflict and commits to tackling them  as a route to securing development.24 At the operational level, the UN Assistance Mission  in Somalia represents an important step forward. It is  the first mission to include a dedicated environmen - tal and climate security adviser.25 The United Nations  is deploying similar advisers elsewhere. Civil society organizations and international agen - cies have launched many initiatives that build peace  and address environmental degradation simultane - ously in historically conflict-prone areas. In the Sahel,  where climate change impacts and overuse of water  have exacerbated tension between pastoralists and  farmers, multiple projects are improving resource  management and animal health, facilitating access  to markets, helping pastoralists diversify sources of  income and managing conflict.26 Across the borders  of Israel, Jordan and the State of Palestine, the non - governmental organization EcoPeace builds mutual  understanding among communities whose security  is impacted by shortfalls in water and energy access  relating to environmental decline.27 In Uganda the  Strengthening Resilience and Inclusive Governance  project aims to defuse tensions between refugees and  host communities who would otherwise be compet - ing for the same charcoal resources and in the pro - cess would use it unsustainably.28 All these examples  can be learned from and scaled up. Towards an environment of peace There are, broadly, two areas in which governments  and other decisionmaking institutions need to take action to mitigate the growing threat to peace posed  by the twin crises. One is to link up responses to insecurity and envi - ronmental degradation, at every level from policy - making down to projects, so that manifestations of  the crises are tackled holistically. This cannot be only  about responses to emerging situations  — it must also  be anticipatory, involving horizon scanning, forecast - ing, knowledge sharing and resilience building. The second is to get on with solving the under - lying environmental threats. Security risks will keep  growing until society rebuilds the natural resource  base, restores biodiversity, aggressively limits pollu - tion and reduces greenhouse gas emissions to net-ze - ro. Moves to do this must be undertaken in a just and  peaceful way  — but they must be undertaken. The Stockholm International Peace Research In - stitute report Environment of Peace,29 launched in  May 2022, concludes with six recommendations for  action and five principles to guide them. The prin - ciples include approaching the crises cooperative - ly, because a nationalistic approach to threats faced  in common is clearly illogical and inefficient. Gov - ernments need to combine far-sighted vision and  strategy with urgent action and to adapt strategies  as they go along because the manifestations of the  twin crises will evolve. All the transitions needed  to halt and reverse environmental degradation, in - cluding climate change, must be enacted justly and  peacefully  — which also implies enacting them inclu - sively, ensuring that affected people are involved in  decisionmaking and share in the benefits. The recommendations themselves include some  that will build resilience. For example: • All governments should carry out a risk assess - ment on the security risks posed by environmental  decline. • All transboundary resources such as river basins  should be covered by resource-sharing agree - ments, and those agreements should be made fit  for purpose in an era of climate change. • Early warning systems for conflict should include  indicators of environmental change. Others address root causes. For example: • Governments should, as far and fast as possible,  stop funding conflict risk through building up  weaponry and subsidising fossil fuels and instead  fund environmental restoration and peace. 66 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 • The public and private sectors should proactively  identify and reduce conflict risks in the clean tech - nology supply chain. • Indigenous peoples and other marginalized groups  should routinely be involved in making decisions  that concern them. All the recommendations can be implemented  within the next few years. And all should be. Gov - ernments agreed, in approving the Working Group 2 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change in February 2022, that there is “a brief and  rapidly closing window to secure a liveable and sus - tainable future for all.”30 The context of its words was  climate change; but they are equally applicable across  the entire risk landscape of the twin security and en - vironmental crises. With the escalating risks having  been identified, it is clearly in every government’s  self-interest to act.

CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 67 New low-carbon technologies such as electric vehi - cles and renewable energy generation will require  much larger inputs of nonrenewable minerals than  are needed for high-carbon energy sources, such as  petroleum-powered cars.1 In many instances these  minerals are found in a very limited number of loca - tions, often low- and middle-income countries.2 Africa hosts some of the largest reserves of many  of the minerals used to produce low-carbon technol - ogies at scale.3 And by 2040 renewable energy is pro - jected to account for 75 percent of Africa’s new power  generation and 40 percent of its total power genera - tion.4 These two trends could boost economic growth  and improve living standards. But many resource-rich  countries have suffered from a “resource curse,” with  resource wealth fuelling violent conflict, heightened  poverty and social inequality.5 The shift to low-car - bon technologies and renewable energy raises con - cerns about potential “green resource curses.” There are multiple channels for low-carbon tran - sitions to lead to conflict and dispossession. A recent  mapping of renewable energy projects and conflict  sites across five African countries revealed a sub - stantial correlation. Proximity to a renewable energy  site was strongly associated with higher conflict risk  across green activities, ranging from establishing re - newable energy projects to green mineral mining to  producing renewable energy.6 Establishing and operating renewable energy pro - jects are frequently fraught with tension over land  acquisition, employment opportunities and benefit  sharing — often compounded by a lack of consultation  with existing landowners and users, especially where  customary land users may lack written documenta - tion of their claims. Grievances were compounded  by concerns about local employment opportunities  and the lack of a mechanism for reinvesting project  revenues in the local community.7 Moreover, many  residents in the communities closest to the project sites were not afforded access to the national electric  grid, despite ceding their historical lands for project  development. Tensions often persist after projects become op - erational. Key reasons include limited employment  opportunities and a perceived lack of benefit shar - ing among the communities most impacted by such  projects. When the benefits and value produced from  such projects are seen as benefitting far-away elites or  a rival status group, the potential for conflict is high.  This risk can be reduced by including local communi - ties and indigenous and marginalized groups in pro - ject planning. Green mineral mining is also a classic example of  a potential resource curse. From cobalt and coltan  in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to lithium  in Zambia and Zimbabwe to copper across much of  southern Africa, the region holds enough mineral  wealth to support the mass production of low-car - bon technologies.8 Yet, resource curse dynamics are  a threat where economic diversification is limited, in - stitutions are weak and potential for resource capture  is high. Even where conflict is less prevalent, many such  projects are plagued by unsafe conditions, environ - mental degradation and benefits that fail to accrue to  the local communities.9 Voluntary governance initia - tives, such as limiting the sale of conflict diamonds,  can help prevent green resource curse dynamics but  require coordination across the supply chain of min - eral producers, processers and consumers. The adverse impacts associated with renewable  energy production have yet to reach the conflicts  sparked by fossil fuel production. But given the pro - jected growth of renewable energy, active policy in - terventions will be needed to reduce conflict risks  associated with low-carbon transitions.10 Source: This spotlight builds on Aas Rustad and others (2022).SPOTLIGHT 1.7 Low-carbon transformations: A green resource curse? 68 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 NOTES 1 Leonard and others 2022; Aas Rustad and others 2022. 2 See, for example, IEA (2021b). 3 Aas Rustad and others 2022; IEA 2021b. 4 IEA 2014, 2019. 5 Aas Rustad and others 2022; Leonard and others 2022.6 Aas Rustad and others 2022. 7 Aas Rustad and others 2022; Schilling, Locham and Scheffran 2018. 8 Aas Rustad and others 2022; IEA 2021b; Leonard and others 2022. 9 Aas Rustad and others 2022; Frankel, Mucha and Sadof 2018; Ochab  2020. 10 Leonard and others 2022; Schilling, Locham and Scheffran 2018. CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 69 Pursuing socioenvironmental justice now and leaving  a thriving planet for the generations that follow require  both knowledge and imagination. Not only do we need  to know how to pursue and realize such things as social  justice and ecosystem health, but we also need to be  able to imagine relationships and responsibilities far  beyond our own temporally and spatially bound lives.  For instance, to “[meet] the needs of the present with - out compromising the ability of future generations  to meet their own needs,”1 we must both know what  meeting needs requires now and be able to imagine  what the lives of future generations might be like in a  range of different and distant futures. Philosophers have developed several theories of  intergenerational justice that animate the normative  underpinnings of our responsibilities to future gen - erations.2 Some theories take the view that justice  requires that we imagine ourselves choosing prin - ciples to govern intergenerational responsibilities.  To enforce fairness, the choice procedure removes  knowledge of exactly which generation we (the deci - sionmakers) will belong to.3 Other theories contend  that justice requires that we imagine having to justify  any courses of action we take now directly to our de - scendants who will inherit the consequences of those  actions.4 For other theories justice requires that we  imagine ourselves situated such that we must justify  our actions now directly to our ancestors given their  values, aspirations and expectations.5 Similarly, other  theories start out from the contention that justice re - quires we imagine ourselves as part of connected and  overlapping intergenerational communities extend - ing backwards and forwards in time.6 In line with this  view Indigenous philosophies situate each genera - tion as part of a “series of never-ending beginnings”7  — each born in the imaginations of generations past,  with the responsibility to set the course for the jour - neys that follow.8 Our cultural values, narratives and practices have a  vital role in protecting and enabling intergenerational links  — connecting past, present and future genera - tions.9 Polynesian ocean-voyaging narratives, for ex - ample, trace descent lines across the expanses of the  Pacific Ocean, the largest body of water on Earth,  in some cases all the way to the Southern Ocean and  Antarctica.10 Land-based narratives story ancestral  migrations that weave networks of communities into  the land and waterways  — embedding connections and  responsibilities through and across multiple genera - tions.11 Socioenvironmental practices enact values that  preserve relationships and knowledge transmission.12  Together, these theories, cultural values and practic - es provide critical conceptual and cognitive tools that  bridge distant people and places in ways that situate  the current generation as having responsibilities as  part of a far-reaching intergenerational community.13 Our theories, values and practices are grounded in  the aspiration to leave behind a thriving planet. This  aspiration is reflected in the way we live our individ - ual and collective lives hopeful that what we value,  create and pursue will endure. It is similarly reflected  in the way we make policies based in part on the leg - acies that those policies will chart and enable in the  long run. There tends to be, in other words, “a con - ceptual connection between valuing something and  wanting it to be sustained.”14 Indeed, what we leave  behind for future generations shapes not just how  meaningful their lives will be but how meaningful our  lives can be said to have been as well. The uncertainty complex outlined in this year’s Re - port, while reinforcing this aspiration, highlights a  more fundamental aspiration and challenge as well:  namely, that there will be a future of some sort at all.  While previous generations have largely been able to  take a stable planetary system for granted, our gen - eration faces the challenge of ensuring the planet’s  long-term survival. Such a predicament reinforces  the urgent need for pathways through which differ - ent ideas, fresh perspectives and appropriate socio - environmental practices can be enabled and enacted SPOTLIGHT 1.8 The new uncertainty complex and  intergenerational justice Krushil Watene (Ngāti Manu, Te Hikutu, Ngāti Whātua o Orākei, Tonga),  Massey University, New Zealand 70 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 now. More specifically, our collective challenge pro - vides an opportunity to adopt the kind of long-term  intergenerational thinking that grounds Indigenous  (and many other) philosophies  — which Tim Mulgan  refers to as “multigenerationalism.”15 According to  this view, the best way to find meaning in the world  today is to embark on projects spanning several gen - erations that come to fruition only long after the pres - ent generation is gone. To do multigenerationalism well, or even at all,  however, we must remember what we truly need to flourish,16 and we must be courageous enough to re - make our local and global systems in ways that will  truly enable and sustain that flourishing.17 What is  more, we have to find the courage to radically change  our values and narratives so that our descendants  might still be here to pursue planetary wellbeing and  justice long after we are gone.18 Perhaps most impor - tant, we must have “radical hope”19 — we must hope  for a world that we know may never materialize in the  future and yet still find the courage to hold the course  towards that future anyway.

CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 71  PART I — UNCERTAIN TIMES, UNSETTLED LIVESCHAPTER 2 Unsettled minds in  uncertain times Mental distress —an obstacle to human development 74 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022Unsettled lives mean unsettled minds. What does that have to do with human development? This chapter makes the case that mental distress  weighs on human development in many ways,  ultimately limiting people’s freedom to live the lives  they have reason to value. The effects are especially  damaging to children and can perpetuate inequality  in intergenerational cycles of mental distress and  socioeconomic hardship. Breaking these cycles  requires action from people and policymakers on  three fronts: preventing distress, mitigating crises  and building psychological resilience.CHAPTER 2 Unsettled minds in uncertain times:   Mental distress —an obstacle to human development The preceding chapter documented the novel and  unprecedented uncertainties affecting people’s lives.  This chapter dives into how uncertainty can cause  mental distress,1 with implications for the way people  feel, think, act and interact with each other through - out their lives, restraining their freedom to achieve  and to live lives they have reason to value.2 It shows  how mental distress can constrain human develop - ment and reinforce and perpetuate inequalities. It  also emphasizes early childhood  — as crucial for de - veloping the brain and body but subject to the devas - tating consequences of toxic stress. Mental wellbeing shapes the way people think, act  and interact.3 Individual emotion,4 perception, cog - nition and motivation5 are set in a social context of  circumstances, relationships and culture.6 Emotions,  such as anger, can drive people to interpersonal vi - olence or to violent conflict, but they can also trig - ger actions against injustices (see chapter 3).7 And  emotions can help in dealing with an unpredictable  world (with some arguing that emotions reflect evo - lutionary adaptations).8 Healthy regulation of emo - tions and overall mental wellbeing are crucial for  peaceful and cohesive societies  — and thus for human  development. “ Healthy regulation of emotions and  overall mental wellbeing are crucial  for peaceful and cohesive societies  —  and thus for human development Mental distress can hinder people from devel - oping their full potential.9 For instance, even when  free high-quality education is universally available,  a student suffering from anxiety and insomnia has  the choice to go to school but may not be able to con - centrate because of mental distress and will thus not  be able to learn as easily as her peers. These individ - ual limitations in one aspect of human development  can be carried over to other dimensions and different  stages of the lifecycle, as when the same student later  seeks employment, and can even act intergeneration - ally through distress during pregnancy and beyond. A crucial task for people and policymakers is thus  to prevent and mitigate mental distress. Since not all  adversity can be prevented or mitigated, this chapter  and the policy options presented in chapter 6 empha - size the importance of psychological resilience that enables people to thrive despite adversity and that is  intrinsically linked to agency, a critical component of  human development (see chapter 3).10 How mental distress constrains  human development In the absence of psychological resilience, mental  distress can result in mental disorders. These are as - sociated with poor education achievements,11 low  productivity at work,12 poverty,13 premature and ex - cess mortality14 and poor overall health. Many people  suffer from mental health–related problems, com - monly measured by the number of diagnosed mental  disorders (spotlight 2.1). To understand the links among mental distress,  mental wellbeing and human development, the ca - pabilities approach  — focusing on the capabilities that  enable people to expand their freedoms to do and be  what they value and have reason to value  — can be  helpful. Capabilities are a combination of things a  person is able to do or be  — the various functionings  he or she can achieve.15 Each person has his or her  conversion function, with individual conversion fac - tors that determine the ability to turn resources into  capabilities (figure 2.1). While mental wellbeing can influence choices and  behaviour at multiple stages and can be a function - ing itself, mental distress shapes individual conver - sion factors, affecting each person’s ability to convert  goods and services into capabilities. The complete  set of achieved functionings also affects the amount  and intensity of mental distress a person is exposed  to. For example, a person with high income can afford  to live in a safe neighbourhood, but a person with low  income may not. So, the low-income person will be  exposed to more mental distress caused by neigh - bourhood insecurity, which in turn will affect her con - version factors. In childhood The impact of mental distress on conversion factors,  and thus capability sets, shapes not only children’s  individual lives but also human development pros - pects in adult life, with implications for society. Expo - sure to frequent or long-term toxic stress or adversity,  CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 75 combined with weak support systems, impairs the de - velopment of neural circuits responsible for emotion - al self-regulation, cognition and behaviour.16 In some  cases this creates long-term physical and mental  health problems, including damage to the developing  brain.17 A child’s developing brain sets the foundation  for future learning, behaviour and health.18 Damages  are difficult, though not impossible, to remedy later  in life. When stressors such as domestic violence, child  maltreatment or extreme poverty activate the stress  response system frequently or over an extended pe - riod, physiological responses that usually deal with  short-term stress remain activated or become per - manently calibrated to activate more easily and do  not turn off as readily as they should. They then can  overwhelm the biological system (called allostat - ic overload) and impair the development of neural  connections (figure 2.2).19 Abundant empirical ev - idence shows that this process, apart from causing (chronic) mental disorders, can increase the pos - sibility of obesity, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular  disease, substance abuse, autoimmune disease, im - paired cognition and interpersonal and self-directed  violence.20 And even without mental disorders, emo - tions and cognition can be impaired with a similar  effect on some parts of the body, since processes in  the brain are linked with those in the microbiome and  the gut.21 These interactions shape the possibilities for learn - ing, earning good income and leading a long and  healthy life. They can thus constrain the conversion  function and the ability to turn resources into ca - pabilities and may shape choices with potentially  long-lasting effects throughout the lifecycle. Basic  trust established during infancy22 and supportive re - lationships with caregivers and other adults in the  community can buffer some of these effects23 and  build resilience. Role models are especially im - portant, as is perceived self-efficacy  — both shape Figure 2.1 Mental distress constrains freedom to achieve, choices and achievements ResourcesIndividual conversion factorsCapability  setChoice   Social context and inﬂuence Functionings Mental distressAchievements Means to  achieveFreedom to  achieve Source: Human Development Report Office based on Lengfelder (2021) and Robeyns (2017). 76 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 children’s aspirations and beliefs in how much they  can achieve.24 But when caregivers and other adults  in the social network themselves face adversity or  permanent stressors, these support structures may  be weak or even counterproductive. Severe maternal  distress also seems to alter DNA.25 Mothers’ exposure  to adversity can increase defensive behaviour among  offspring, which might be biologically useful in ma - lign environments but can also lead to pathologies,  even among children raised in safe environments  after the adversity subsides.26 Such children are not necessarily doomed for life.  Multiple biological, psychological, social and ecolog - ical systems interact to build resilience, which helps  them absorb some distress throughout the lifecycle. The interplay of individual, social and community  factors can produce secure attachments, cognitive  reappraisals, family cohesion, social structures and  support networks.27 Exposure to nature can also make  a difference. People, particularly children,28 who are  frequently exposed to nature or spend much time  outdoors tend to be more resilient to adversity and  mental distress than those who do not.29 In adulthood For adults severe mental distress can impair capa - bilities in a similar way  — but at a time when the de - velopment of the brain and other organs is already  Figure 2.2 Connecting mental and physical health Brain and autonomic nervous system Manage and respond Neuroendocrine system Maintain hormonal balance Immune system Defend against infection and  health injuryHeart and cardiovascular system Pump blood, distribute oxygen and glucose Gut and metabolic system Turn food into energyStress response Fight or ﬂightStressors Stressors Source: National Scientific Council on the Developing Child 2020. CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 77 advanced or concluded. Still, adults who suffer from  mental distress over an extended period have im - paired conversion factors, resulting in constrained ca - pability sets (or freedoms to achieve). That includes  the ability to continue learning, to work and earn in - come, to lead a long and healthy life, to have attach - ments to things and people, to form perceptions of  good and bad, to plan one’s own life, to affiliate with  others, to care about other species and to enjoy rec - reational activities30 — even if external conditions are  favourable. Some external conditions, such as access  to information or health services, can also help build  psychological resilience among adults, which can ab - sorb some of the stress and provide room to deal with  future adversity.31 Mental health at older ages part - ly reflects individual adversities and resilience, but  some other mental disorders common among older  people have other causes.32 “ In uncertain times mental distress among  individuals can have costs for societies,  as it restrains people from reaching their  full potential throughout the lifecycle  In uncertain times mental distress among individ - uals can have costs for societies, as it restrains peo - ple from reaching their full potential throughout the  lifecycle  — thus constraining human development.  And since different people are exposed to different  levels of mental distress, it can increase inequalities  and even perpetuate them when distress is trans - ferred from caregivers to children. Unsettled minds amid  multidimensional uncertainties New and persistent drivers of insecurity unsettle peo - ple’s lives in the context of uncertainty (see chap - ter 1). They include multiple forms of violence, which  comprise violent conflict between groups and inter - personal violence, ranging from domestic to neigh - bourhood violence. Other stressors may not always  threaten physical wellbeing but can still cause serious  mental distress: discrimination, exclusion, econom - ic insecurity and uncertainties associated either with  the more frequent and extreme hazards of the An - thropocene or with transitions and rapid technologi - cal change, as with digitalization.The Anthropocene context is a driver of uncertain - ty without precedent in human history. It is manifest  not only in climate change but also in biodiversity  loss and the depletion and contamination of natural  resources.33 Efforts to ease planetary pressures are  also a source of uncertainty, driving real or perceived  threats associated with the transitions in economic  and social systems in a context of rapid digital trans - formation. Precarious jobs, digital inequality, cyber - attacks, data fraud and concentrated digital power  can all cause serious mental distress. This section  discusses evidence showing how these manifesta - tions of uncertainty affect mental wellbeing and can  also drive inequalities in human development. Minds pressured in the Anthropocene As discussed in chapter 1, dangerous planetary  change in the Anthropocene is reflected in climate  change, biodiversity loss and the more frequent  emergence or re-emergence of zoonotic diseases,  with Covid-19 likely the latest. The effects on mental  wellbeing run through several channels: • Traumatizing events. The increase in extreme  weather events often goes hand in hand with losses  or damages of housing or crops as well as injuries  and even deaths of loved ones. These experiences  can cause tremendous human suffering, often  leading to post-traumatic stress (spotlight 2.2),  anxiety, depression, distress, grief, survivor guilt,  substance abuse and even suicide.34 • Physical illness. Exposure to extreme heat can cause  heat exhaustion, leading to mental distress.35 And  sharp spikes in temperature cause irritability, more  aggressive thoughts and feelings, and even vio - lent behaviour.36 Following distress and grief that  Covid-19 has caused around the world (see below),  the constant possibility of another deadly variant  or a new zoonotic disease also pressures minds in  the Anthropocene. • General climate- or eco-anxiety and solastalgia.  Climate change can have two different effects on  people, depending partly on psychological resil - ience. It increases general anxiety and worries  about the future,37 which encourages some people  to become agents for climate action but may leave  others feeling anxious and incapable of changing  78 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 anything.38 Young people claim that governments  around the world have dismissed or neglected their  requests for urgent action.39 Indigenous peoples  from around the world, among the most affected  by climate change, have suffered mental distress  over seasonal changes and acute weather events.40 • Food insecurity. With increasing extreme weather  events disrupting food production and access,  food insecurity is on the rise again after decades  of decline.41 In addition to being a threat to phys - ical health, it is also a serious mental stressor.42 It  has been associated with psychological distress in  both low and high human development countries.43  In several African countries women and older  people are especially affected. The most effective  interventions target livelihoods as opposed to  income only.44 • Biodiversity loss. Biodiversity loss can drive mental  distress, especially among indigenous and mar - ginalized communities, leading to longer-term  adverse psychological and behavioural impacts,  such as increased family stress, amplification of  previous trauma, greater likelihood of substance  abuse and higher prevalence of suicide ideation.45  While causal mechanisms are yet to be fully under - stood, some reasons can include that biodiversity  loss causes disruptions to physical health through  altered food systems or leads to a different sense  of place that can undermine cultural practices  and knowledge systems. Moreover, it can impair  self-determination by reducing the sufficiency of  locally available resources, and it can result in a  loss of social capital as community members rely  increasingly on outside sources of aid and income  rather than on one another.46 The adverse consequences of climate change are  already affecting people who more directly depend  on agriculture and natural resources for their live - lihoods, including those in communities in rural,  coastal, mountainous or forest areas, many of them  indigenous.47 Since many of these people live in low- income countries and are already disadvantaged,  mental distress and its effects on the conversion fac - tors can further increase inequalities in freedoms to  achieve. The depletion of natural resources and land-use  changes through deforestation and for agricultur - al use are putting pressures on biodiversity and threatening the integrity of ecosystem functions, with  several unknown threats potentially to come, includ - ing more frequent zoonotic diseases.48 As discussed  in chapter 1, the Covid-19 pandemic may be the latest  but surely will not be the last, with implications that  include multiple lockdowns all over the world that  may cause mental distress in the future as they did  during Covid-19.49 “ Biodiversity loss can drive mental distress,  especially among indigenous and mar  ginalized  communities, leading to longer-term adverse  psychological and behavioural impacts During the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic,  the global prevalence of depression and anxiety in - creased by more than 25 percent.50 The increase  was greater among women than men, most likely  because women were more affected by the socio - economic consequences of lockdowns.51 In a global  survey 77  percent of respondents reported moderate  to severe stress and poor sleep, and 59 percent suf - fered from anxiety and 35 percent from depression  (only 18 percent had previously been diagnosed with  a mental disorder).52 Young people suffered  — most  likely because of missed opportunities during multi - ple lockdowns.53 People with low incomes, struggling  to afford basic needs such as rent and food, suffered  disproportionally in several countries.54 Women, who took on most of the additional do - mestic and care work that emerged during school  closures and lockdowns,55 faced more mental dis - tress than before the Covid-19 pandemic.56 A cross- country survey found that 27 percent of women  struggled with mental distress, compared with  10 percent of men. Women cited their escalating un - paid care burden as a critical stressor, alongside con - cerns about food, healthcare and livelihoods. Given  the links among employment, income, food security  and mental health, it is noteworthy that 55 percent of  women reported income loss as the top impact of the  pandemic (compared with 34 percent of men) and  that 41 percent of women (versus 30 percent of men)  reported not having enough food.57 Ethnic minorities  of both sexes were severely affected in the United  Kingdom, with the largest increase in mental distress  among men with a background from Bangladesh,  India or Pakistan (figure 2.3).58 CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 79 More than two years into the Covid-19 pandemic,  worries about the virus have somewhat dissipated in  parts of the world. But anxiety about new variants  —  and the possibility of mandatory quarantines, lock - downs and cancellations  — remains around the globe.  The abrupt halt and related uncertainty that the pan - demic inflicted on many people’s lives will likely lin - ger for some time. Economic insecurity drives mental distress Economic insecurity  — expressed in periods of low in - come, unemployment, poor working conditions, pov - erty, housing instability and financial shocks  — can  cause mental distress. Even the perception that such  outcomes could materialize may give people reason  to worry, particularly in contexts of economic precar - iousness or dislocations. And even when these dislo - cations are transitory or small relative to the scale of  an economy, they can loom as scary threats in par - ticular regions or sectors.59 The causal relation also works in reverse: people  with impaired mental (and physical) health have fewer employment opportunities and can face income pen - alties for their conditions.60 Especially in economic  contexts where brain-based skills such as emotional in - telligence, creativity, cognitive flexibility, self-control  or system thinking matter more than manual skills,61  mental wellbeing is increasingly important to thrive in  the professional world, while the lack of it can further  exacerbate disadvantages. In other contexts where  people work in agriculture, they are being increasingly  exposed to the stresses of extreme weather events that  jeopardize their source of income and food security  —  and with it both physical and mental wellbeing. The association of economic insecurity with men - tal distress starts very early in life, indeed in the  mother’s womb. Some foetuses are exposed to more  stress and worry related to poverty, malnutrition, vi - olence or environmental irritants associated with  poverty (such as pollution or extreme temperatures)  than others.62 The intergenerational effect contin - ues during childhood when parents’ mental distress  impairs children’s wellbeing, with effects into adult - hood.63 If the situation continues throughout child - hood, this can lead to long-term adaptive behaviour  and pathologies that are hard to break later in life.64  For instance, children who grow up with food insecu - rity often continue binge eating even after hardship is  overcome.65 These effects can be buffered by social  institutions or informal aid in the community, such as  cash transfers to mothers, which have been shown to  improve infant brain activity and subsequent cogni - tive skills and mental wellbeing.66 Even less severe conditions of low socioeconomic  status and related social structures can affect chil - dren’s brain and body development, cognitive func - tioning and mental and physical health. For example,  children in families who live in crowded, chaotic  or noisy conditions or unsafe neighbourhoods and  who lack organization and daily routines are usually  exposed to higher mental distress.67 And the belief  in how much one is capable of achieving — which is  usually lower in low socioeconomic status families   — can diminish children’s aspirations and achieve - ments.68 These factors can accumulate,69 which is in  line with models of cumulative advantage and dis - advantage that look at socioeconomic disparities in  general and health disparities in particular.70 The  2019 Human Development Report analysed in de - tail how this mechanism acts in intergenerational Figure 2.3 In the United Kingdom mental distress is most  prevalent among female minority groups, but mental  distress among male minority groups increased most  during the Covid-19 pandemic Mental distress BIP  menNon- BIP  menWhite British  men15 14 13 12 11 010 BIP  womenNon- BIP  womenWhite British  women95% conﬁdence  interval2017–2019 April 2020  BIP refers to people with a background from Bangladesh, India or Pakistan.

However,  even people with higher incomes can experience re - sentment and frustrations due to financial concerns,  especially when aspirations are very high and the so - cial environment is such that people perceive high in - equality compared with their peers.80 Status incongruence is an important concept here.  For example, having a high level of education in a  manual occupation or low-skilled nonmanual occupa - tion has been shown to cause emotional discomfort,  such as feelings of shame and anxiety,81 pessimistic  outlooks and overall poor mental wellbeing. With  rising education levels and labour markets that are  unable to absorb all qualified labour, cases of status  incongruence have increased and are expected to be - come even more prevalent.82 Positive expectations  and belief in the ability to achieve one’s goals can par - tially compensate for negative effects on mental well - being.83 Finally, at older ages a higher debt burden  Box 2.1 Multidimensional uncertainties may make some people subject to human trafficking — another source of  severe mental distress Multidimensional uncertainties make some people want to look for a better future elsewhere. But bureaucratic ob - stacles often stand in the way of free migration, so that some people fall victim to human trafficking. Networks  of organized crime consisting of traffickers typically make false promises of education or job opportunities using  fraudulent employment agencies to trick victims before applying violence and coercion.1 The experience of being  trafficked is often traumatic, with restriction of movement and violence, and fear of being discovered, detained and  deported.2 An Ethiopia-based study found that among human trafficked returnees the prevalence of depression was  about 58 percent, that of anxiety 52 percent and that of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 35 percent. Restricted  movement was associated with anxiety, depression and PTSD, whereas experiencing violence during trafficking was  linked to anxiety and PTSD. Detention contributed to all three disorders.3 A study of trafficked women and girls from Monterrey and Reynosa (Mexico) found that all of the study’s participants  were experiencing feelings of tension, stress, anxiety, worry and anger and that most of them were crying more than  usual (86 percent), lacking appetite (86 percent) and having suicidal thoughts (80 percent).4 Among human trafficking  survivors in the Greater Mekong subregion, men, women and children who had experienced violence during traffick - ing faced a higher prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD than those who did not.5 In addition to experiencing  mental distress, many victims of human trafficking do not find what they had expected at their destination but face  new challenges, such as adaptation to a new environment and sometimes even dependence and human rights  violations from their traffickers. From a human development perspective human trafficking takes away people’s agency and freedoms as well as  the possibility for them to make their own choices and determine their futures. Managing safe migration is crucial to  tackling human trafficking and should be taken up through cooperation and partnership among countries.

CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 81 can cause social and emotional loneliness, independ - ent of social participation, social network size, and  previous states of anxiety or depression.84 Moreover,  there is a growing understanding of the long-term  impacts of income downturns.85 When an econom - ic downturn coincides with a health shock, as with  Covid-19, the implications can be magnified and per - petuated across generations.86 The channel for much  of the lasting scarring to take hold relates primarily  to behavioural and psychological impacts that have  implications throughout life, even after the economy  bounces back.87 Causality also runs the other way. Mental distress  lowers people’s ability to work productively and dis - torts the way people think, with consequences for the  way they search for work, interact with people and  carry out their work.88 Alleviating financial worries  improves workers’ productivity, making them more  attentive, faster and less prone to mistakes,89 as pov - erty appears to burden cognitive capacity (but see the  discussion in chapter 3 suggesting that the burden  may be contingent on social context).90 It can also  modify the content of cognition, adding a monetary  perspective to many dimensions of life, which is diffi - cult to suppress and may shape decisionmaking and social relationships.91 Conversely, poverty alleviation  can improve socialization and other noncognitive  skills, such as agreeableness and conscientiousness,  while diminishing hostility and aggression.92 Severe mental distress can undermine physical  health, which can lead to an inability to carry out cer - tain work  — and increase health spending where there  are gaps in health insurance or public provision of  health services.93 Furthermore, mental distress can  result in job loss or income decline, not least because  it affects preferences, beliefs, cognitive functioning  and ultimately economic decisionmaking.94 People  with depression earn about 34 percent less than the  average person, people with bipolar disorder about  38 percent less and people with schizophrenia about  74 percent less. People with these conditions also  face a much higher risk of no income and disability.95  And the lack of income can cause even more men - tal distress. The circular relation has been found to  nearly double the negative impact of financial shocks,  explaining low financial resilience in a long-term  mental distress–  poverty trap.96 The circular and intergenerational relation between  economic insecurity and mental distress can perpetu - ate economic inequality across generations (figure 2.4).

They can even accelerate the achievement of the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).97 A recent  study covering more than 200 countries found that  mobile phone access was associated with higher gen - der equality through multiple channels (lower mater - nal mortality, better information about sexual and  reproductive health services, higher empowerment  to make independent decisions, with larger gains  among the least developed countries and among the  most disadvantaged groups).98 In this sense digitali - zation can contribute to empowerment, essential for  mental wellbeing. But the benefits of these new technologies also  come with challenges. Digitalization poses sever - al social and economic threats, including, but not  limited to, lower labour demand for some tasks,99  digital inequality and exclusion,100 cybercrime and  the related theft of financial resources and personal  information,101 transfer of decisionmaking powers  to machines, digital power concentration,102 digital  addictions103 and violence,104 and reduced personal  life security.105 One of the most serious challenges  of digitalization is digital inequality.106 Poor peo - ple and those with existing mental disorders have  a higher probability of being digitally excluded,  which potentially increases inequalities in other  areas.107 Some of these challenges can cause mental dis - tress, despite the fact that some of the benefits of  digital technologies foster mental wellbeing (figure  2.5). For instance, cyberharassment and cyberstalk - ing have been associated with anxiety, panic attacks,  suicidal ideation108 and depression.109 Mobile devices,  social networks and cloud computing services can be  used to stalk people and conduct surveillance.110 Dig - ital platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twit - ter can be used in a similar way as well as for social  comparison, negative interactions, cyberbullying,  and sharing violent content and violent or discrim - inative language.111 This has been associated with  mental distress and suicidal behaviour, with the  highest prevalence among girls.112 Older people may  feel excluded from socialization when the younger generation spends time on social media or with other  technologies. Digital exclusion can be found among healthcare  services. While digital healthcare services can pro - vide substantial benefits for people with fast internet  connections and digital skills  — and thus have poten - tial to widen access to health services among some  remote populations (box 2.2) — people without these  advantages are less likely to benefit from services.113 While access to information can be empowering,  abundant and sometimes false information (which is  easy to distribute through social media) can also be  a source of anxiety. Not only can people feel anxious  because of too much and sometimes contradictory  information, but they may also stress about infor - mation that is not even true. During the early stag - es of the Covid-19 pandemic, and often continuing  beyond, false information about the virus, its cures  and vaccines went viral on communication platforms  such as Facebook and Twitter, causing anxiety in  many people.114 The abundance of information seems  to constitute a stressor (information overload), mak - ing it more likely that people share false information.115 Another way digitalization can cause men - tal distress is obsessive use of digital technol - ogies, digital platforms and digital devices.116  Obsessive smartphone use can result in chronic sleep Figure 2.5 Digitalization is a double-edged sword for  mental wellbeing Empowerment  through access to  information Easier access to  mental health services More opportunities  for (virtual)  social engagementBeneﬁts for mental wellbeing Information overload  and false information Digital addictions Cybercrime Cyberharassment,  cyberstalking,  cyberbullying and  social isolation Burden for mental wellbeing Source: Human Development Report Office. CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 83 deprivation and undermines cognitive control and  socioemotional functioning.117 Digital technology  can also promote gambling — an activity associated  with mental disorders.118 Young people in particular  appear to engage in digital gambling on social plat - forms, smartphones and specialized websites.119 The  World Health Organization has recognized gaming  disorder as a mental health issue, given its adverse  health impacts and increasing prevalence.120 Cybercrime, such as fraud, theft, scams and other  forms of online financial exploitation, can cause ex - cessive worrying and anxiety and has been linked to  depression among older adults.121 Moreover, inter - net use reduces offline interaction, political partici - pation and civic cultural engagement,122 increasing  the likelihood of social isolation.123 By contrast, dig - ital technology can also create social engagement  opportunities that help eliminate loneliness and so - cial isolation124 and improve wellbeing125 — for exam - ple, by connecting to people with similar interests or  problems over long distances (self-help forums). By  doing so, digital technology can also alleviate mental  distress.126Violence scares, unsettles and scars lives Given the direct threat to physical integrity, most  forms of violence cause mental distress, often lead - ing to mental disorders such as post-traumatic stress  disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression, and each  form of violence comes with additional challenges  depending on context and setting. Interpersonal vi - olence includes domestic and community violence,  such as intimate partner violence, child or elder abuse  and assaults by strangers. Collective violence occurs  between larger groups, such as organized crime and  armed conflicts.127 Interpersonal violence can increase  inequalities in opportunity Psychologically, domestic violence is extremely toxic,  as the home is a place that should provide protection  and safety, constituting a location to rest and relax  away from other environmental stressors. When sev - eral forms of domestic violence happen simultane - ously, they can create a vicious cycle of dependence Box 2.2 Potential of telehealth for increasing access to mental healthcare Digitalization can improve health systems and the provision of healthcare services1 if digital technologies are readily  available to the whole population. Mobile and electronic interventions allow easy access to mental health services  and information on prevention, counselling and treatment.2 Telehealth, which involves telephone or video via various  web-based applications,3 has gained global prominence over the years. By 2016 more than 50 percent of countries  that responded to a World Health Organization survey reported having a national telehealth policy, about 70 percent  claimed to have a teleradiology programme and approximately 25 percent said they had conducted a telehealth  programme evaluation.4 In many parts of Africa, particularly in rural areas populated mostly by young people, there  is great potential for expanding telehealth services.5 The Covid-19 pandemic massively increased telehealth pro - grammes and platforms. In the United Kingdom the proportion of doctor’s appointments over the phone or by video  call increased from 13 percent in 2019 to 48 percent by mid-2020.6 In some East Asia and Pacific countries7 and in the  United States,8 the number of telehealth users more than doubled in the first month of the pandemic. Since most mental health services do not require physical examinations, digital services are especially promising,  allowing people from remote areas to get help online without traveling long distances. Such services can be more  time and cost efficient, providing support while people wait for face-to-face interventions.9 Undermining these benefits are poor network infrastructure, inadequate funding to support telehealth programmes,  competing health system priorities, internet access inequalities and a lack of digital skills among all or parts of the  population.10 So for digital mental health interventions to improve health outcomes without increasing inequality,  countries need to increase telehealth budgets, expand internet access in deprived communities and empower people  from these communities through education and training on how to use digital devices and platforms.

For instance, the perpetrator controls the  household’s financial resources, making the victim  financially dependent,128 while invoking fear and un - dermining self-worth and self-esteem through verbal  abuse, constant criticism and social isolation, which  can lead to a withdrawal from the labour force, hous - ing stress and ultimately a loss of self-identity.129 The  key here is dominance over the partner through emo - tional, economic or psychological abuse,130 which  then substantially limits the possibilities to escape  physical violence as well. This mechanism is reflected  in data showing that in countries with lower female  labour force participation, more women experience  intimate partner violence (figure 2.6). While men can  certainly also be affected, the majority of intimate  partner violence survivors are women.131 Bisexual and gay men report worse psychologi - cal consequences following intimate partner vio - lence than straight men.132 This is possibly due to the combined burden of mental stressors, including  discrimination, and social pressures of internalized  masculinity norms suggesting that men should be  more resistant to oppression and violence.133 Due to  gender stereotypes in some criminal justice systems,  there also appears to be hesitance to report assaults  out of fear of being misjudged as the perpetrator. In  various country contexts men who had filed police  reports recounted that authorities had responded to  their plea for help with suspicion, ridicule or even  arrest.134 When older people live in a household with fami - ly members, which is common in some cultural con - texts, domestic violence can also be directed towards  them, affecting their physical and mental health.135  This happens more frequently among older people  with physical disabilities (49 percent) and with psy - chological disabilities (7 percent). Many, but not all,  affected older people are female (63 percent).136 Figure 2.6 Intimate partner violence increases with economic dependence Reported intimate partner violence within the past 12 months (%)Female labour force participation (%)  0102030405060708090 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Note: Reported intimate partner violence within the past 12 months includes women and girls over age 15 who have experienced physical and/or sex - ual partner violence.

CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 85 The consequences of domestic violence for mental  wellbeing range from milder symptoms such as ele - vated psychological stress to full-fledged clinical pres - entations of mental disorders such as PTSD, phobias,  substance abuse, depression and anxiety.137 Survivors  of physical domestic violence are also prone to trau - matic brain injury, with devastating consequences for  their ability to function in society, including to work  and socialize.138 All of this can eventually result in a  loss of agency, when individuals no longer feel able to  shape and change their circumstances, lose hope al - together and become vulnerable to revictimization.139 “ More than half the world’s children ages 2–17— around a billion—have experienced emotional,  physical or sexual violence, with devastating  consequences for their mental wellbeing Even when physical attacks are not targeted to - wards them, children are affected through three  channels: • Witnessing attacks on one of their caregivers. • PTSD symptoms of caregivers that undermine  quality of care. • Traumatizing parenting styles or emotional un - availability that emerge as a result of caregivers’  mental distress.140 When children themselves fall victim to psycho - logical, sexual or physical abuse, mental distress is  most severe. More than half the world’s children ages  2–17 —  around a billion  — have experienced emotional,  physical or sexual violence.141 When stressors come  from outside the home, stable relationships with car - egivers typically function as buffers for children’s  mental wellbeing. But when caregivers become ag - gressors, one of the most important instincts  — trust  in caregivers  — becomes damaged, equalling betray - al by the people the child depends on.142 It impairs  basic trust in life and can have severe long-term, and  sometimes irreversible, consequences for children’s  psychological and physical health as well as for their  overall functioning, causing what is called complex  childhood or developmental trauma.143 The conver - sion function of these children thus differs from those  of children who grew up in a nonviolent household,  unless a very favourable combination of resilient  building factors comes together and absorbs part of  the toxic stress the child has suffered.144 Culturally aligned interventions are crucial here, as discussions  of domestic violence are still taboo in many societies,  hindering social workers from intervening and mak - ing mental health treatments available for children. Community violence ranges from isolated acts of  assault by strangers or acquaintances, such as bully - ing, armed robbery and sexual abuse, to workplace  and institutional violence.145 Neighbourhoods are not  simply the physical locations in which we reside; they  are also places with intricate socioeconomic–spa - tial connections (box 2.3).146 While neighbourhood  characteristics  — including education and healthcare  facilities, transport connectivity and crime levels as  well as perceived safety and social cohesion  — may  affect outcomes such as health, education and in - come,147 these same outcomes in turn determine  which neighbourhoods are accessible to people.148  This effect constitutes an obstacle to intra- and inter - generational mobility, as it can trap people in cycles  of low income, poor health and education, and sur - roundings prone to amplifying these disadvantages.149  Mental distress is an additional risk factor in this trap,  given its consequences for cognition, productivity  and overall functioning.150 For children, who typically  depend on their parents’ housing decisions, the effect  is equally strong, if not more severe, since they are  much more vulnerable to mental distress than adults  (see the first section of this chapter).151 Taken to - gether, these factors can perpetuate inequalities, not  only between neighbourhoods but also between cit - ies, countries and regions, as levels of violence vary  across different areas. Collective violence can increase  inequalities between groups of people In some areas of the world, the root cause of neigh - bourhood violence is organized crime. People who  reside in neighbourhoods where drug cartels or other  criminal groups operate experience more mental  distress, not least because of the perceived threat of  violence. Evidence from Mexico shows that informa - tion about brutal acts, such as executions, and about  violent confrontations between the local police and  criminal groups has caused substantial mental dis - tress for community members. On some occasions  this information may be diffused purposely to in - stil fear in the community.152 Mental distress caused  86 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 by organized crime is not limited to victims and the  community. Members of criminal groups also suffer  from mental distress because of chronic exposure to  violence, potentially increasing cycles of violence, as  some types of mental distress can result in aggressive  behaviour.153 Violence during protests, riots and clashes with the  police can cause emotional imbalances, fears, wor - ries and even psychological trauma. Over the past  decade protests, sometimes accompanied by related  political violence, increased substantially, until the Covid-19 pandemic hit (figure 2.7).154 When political  climates change and authorities do not fully respect  the right to freedom of expression, people may sense  repression and start feeling impotent or powerless. Sometimes, frustration throughout the population  can also turn into clashes between protesters and  police, causing mental distress. A protester from  India claims, “[I] freeze up, feel[ing] numb and  uncertain anytime [I] see a policeman, or some - one wielding a lathi, or when streetlights go off.  … I see people break down in gatherings… friends Box 2.3 Neighbourhood violence is bad, but uncertainty around it can make it even worse Direct exposure to violence and the possibility of  experiencing violence as a resident of a neighbour - hood that is perceived as unsafe are significant risk  factors for mental distress. Across Buenos Aires,  Lima, Medellín, Mexico City and São Paulo expo - sure to interpersonal violence — for example, being  beaten up, witnessing death or someone getting in - jured, being mugged or threatened with a weapon,  and sexual violence — and the experience of living  in neighbourhoods with a higher prevalence of  violent crime (after individual violence exposure is  accounted for) are associated with higher odds of  anxiety and mood disorders.1 In Baltimore, Maryland, survey respondents liv - ing in violent crime hotspots report higher rates of  depression (61  percent higher) and post-traumatic  stress disorder (85  percent higher) than residents  in coldspots.2 Depression can be caused by indirect  exposure or other factors related to living in violent  neighbourhoods. In some cases the perceived level  of violence in the neighbourhood and the uncer - tainty around being exposed to it can be at least as  troubling. Adolescents in California who perceive their  neighbourhood as unsafe are twice as likely to ex - perience serious mental distress as their peers who  perceive their neighbourhood as safe. They are also  more likely to suffer from distress than adolescents  who live in neighbourhoods that are considered violent based on objective measures (box figure 1).3 Mental distress can also be exacerbated by an interplay of other factors. Several of these factors in a population- based survey of adults living in a group of favelas  (slums) in Rio de Janeiro — specifically being younger, female or  unemployed; having a lower income; and having experienced and fearing neighbourhood violence — were separately  and significantly associated with poorer mental health outcomes. These factors, together with past experiences of  violence and the fear of violence, were also significantly associated with higher levels of mental distress.4 Notes 1. Benjet and others 2019.  2. Weisburd and others 2018.  3. Goldman-Mellor and others 2016.  4. Cruz and others 2021.Box figure 1 Perceived risk can induce more stress than  actual risk Share of adolescents in California with  serious psychological distress (%) 3.8 9.8 4.1 6.8 Safe Unsafe Nonviolent Violent Perceived  neighborhood safetyObjectively measured  neighborhood violence02468101214161820 Note:  Whiskers indicate the 95 percent confidence interval.

CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 87 getting full-blown panic attacks.”155 The effect can  be as severe as the ones caused by armed conflict,  in which WHO estimates the PTSD rate to be a little  over 21 percent.156 A study from Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region, China, found a combined  prevalence of depression and PTSD of 21.8 percent  among the adult population during the 2019–2020  social unrest. There was also a strong association  between heavy politics-related social media use and  mental distress, attributable to emotion contagion.157  Following violence in Syrian Arab Republic, civilians  expressed panic attacks, especially towards the pos - sibility of “disappearing” while being transferred in  detainment.158 The Syrian conflict also shows how  collective violence, such as riots, battles or violence  against civilians can escalate into armed conflicts  and civil wars.159 When that happens, severe and long-lasting men - tal distress can be the consequence for large parts  of the population, given the nature of traumatic  experiences related to war settings. From the early  2000s until the outbreak of the war in Ukraine,  there have been few interstate conflicts, but the  past decade has witnessed a surge in battle-related deaths due to civil conflicts, some subject to foreign  state interventions.160 In postwar settings about one  in five people suffer from mental health conditions.161  PTSD is very common among war survivors, affect - ing about 354 million adult war survivors,162 not  least because of the direct threat to experiencing vi - olence and the constant possibility of loss or injury  of loved ones.163 Grief and sadness have been relat - ed to addictive behaviour, particularly to increased  substance abuse.164 This may put an additional bur - den on public health systems, considering the long- term consequences of substance abuse for mental  and physical health. Globally comparative data on the prevalence of  PTSD remains a challenge, but more specific exam - ples from war torn countries can provide deeper in - sights into the number of affected people and into  the mechanisms and causalities behind them. Due  to recurrent wars and armed conflicts in Iraq, for ex - ample, the prevalence of PTSD among young people  ages 17–19 is 25 percent,165 and more than two-thirds  of adult men suffer from anxiety and emotional in - stability.166 In Nigeria the Boko Haram insurgency  has contributed to major mental distress, including Figure 2.7 Increases in political violence have meant more uncertainty for many people Number of events 150,000 100,000 50,000 0Protests Riots Battles Violence  against civilians 2020 2010 2015 Note: Protest  is defined as a public demonstration in which the participants do not engage in violence, though violence may be used against them.  Battle  is defined as a violent interaction between two politically organized armed groups at a particular time and location. Battles can occur between  armed and organized state, nonstate and external groups and in any combination therein. Riot is defined as a violent event where demonstrators or  mobs engage in disruptive acts, including but not limited to rock throwing, property destruction and the like. Violence against civilians  is defined as  violent events where an organized armed group deliberately inflicts violence upon unarmed noncombatants. The perpetrators of such acts include  state forces and their affiliates, rebels, militias, and external or other forces (ACLED 2019).

There are other, cul - turally aligned explanations for what people feel and  go through, and following those, people may seek al - ternative approaches to integrative health and men - tal wellbeing.171 About 450  million children  — or one in six  —  currently live in conflict zones, with devastating  consequences for their mental health,172 including  PTSD.173 The PTSD prevalence rate was 44 percent  among child survivors of the Rwandan genocide and  87 percent among children exposed to the bomb - ings in Gaza.174 In Nigeria Boko Haram has recruited  young children to join its militia, causing severe men - tal distress associated with warfare.175 Some of these  effects can be long-lasting if not adequately treated:  children who survived the Viet Nam war show in - creased symptoms of depression in adulthood.176 Apart from the threat to physical integrity, armed  conflicts can expose people to displacement, de - stroy critical infrastructure, disrupt supply chains,  hinder investment and thus undermine economic  growth and development, possibly resulting in mas - sive unemployment — all adding to mental distress of  large parts of the population.177 When armed conflict  forces people to leave their homes, this complicates  the overall situation even further. As of mid-2022 at  least 100 million people are estimated to have been  forcibly displaced from their homes worldwide due  to conflict, with major displacements in Afghanistan,  Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of the Congo,  Ethiopia, Myanmar, Nigeria and Ukraine.178 The war in Ukraine has caused a major increase in  displaced people, with more than 7  million internal - ly displaced persons and more than 5.6 million refu - gees.179 Children, who account for about half of the  displaced, become exposed to all sorts of mental dis - tress.180 Globally, there are now nearly 37 million dis - placed children  — the highest number ever recorded.181  When displaced, people may lose their material pos - sessions, community affiliations and social support networks. And if they flee to another country, possi - bly even their civic duties, access to social services,  professions, occupational identity and much else  — all  risk factors for mental distress that affect people’s ca - pabilities sets.182 In such an environment where peo - ple suffer from impaired health, limited education  opportunities and unemployment, mental distress is  more likely to set in but less likely to be treated be - cause resources are desperately needed on all ends.  Indeed, countries experiencing conflict present the  widest gap between people who need mental health - care services and people who have access to them.183  Community-level approaches are promising for facil - itating access to mental healthcare services in these  settings (box 2.4). “ Some groups of people have been excluded,  disrespected and discriminated against for  centuries, with devastating effects on their mental  wellbeing and human development at large Because some groups of people are affected more  by violence than others, and thus suffer more from  mental distress than others, the alteration of their  conversion factors limits their freedom to achieve  and thus increases inequality of opportunity across  neighbourhoods, districts and even countries, de - pending on the level of violence people are experi - encing (and on access to mental healthcare services  and other resources that can mitigate distress). More - over, the exposure to violence can itself create vicious  cycles of even more violence if left unattended. Discrimination unsettles minds by  attacking human dignity Some groups of people  — including women; certain  ethnic groups; people of colour; people who identify  as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, inter - sex or other sexual minority (LGBTQI+); and people  with disabilities  — have been excluded, disrespected  and discriminated against for centuries, with devas - tating effects on their mental wellbeing and human  development at large. At the institutional level dis - criminatory norms and laws of some countries still  bias the criminal justice system and block access to  high-quality education and health services, economic  CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 89 opportunities and wealth accumulation, attacking  human dignity and increasing inequalities.184 Since many measures of development capture out - comes at the aggregate level, horizontal inequalities  often remain unrevealed, resulting in policies that fail  to address structural discrimination. But people also  suffer from discrimination in their daily lives, when at - tacked or excluded by peers, colleagues or neighbours  or on the streets. Both types of discrimination can  cause mental distress and interact with inequalities, mutually reinforcing each other and creating inter - generational cycles of inequality and discrimination. Structural discrimination reinforces inequalities Structural discrimination and racism have been  found to increase overall health disparities through  several channels,185 including mental distress, envi - ronmental adversities and unequal healthcare.186 Dis - crimination can be seen as a latent form of violence, Box 2.4 Tackling mental distress at the community level The rationale behind community-based mental health services is that they tend to have greater acceptability among  the population — and better accessibility and affordability than most other healthcare options. They typically enable  family involvement, are less prone to stigma and discrimination, promote mental health awareness and have en - hanced clinical effectiveness given the involvement of trusted local providers.1 One example is the Mental Health  Innovation Network’s Basic Needs Mental Health and Development Model, which has reached more than 650,000  people and their family members in different low- and middle-income countries. It has increased access to treatment  among service users by 84 percent, and users have reported a 75 percent reduction in symptoms — all while costing  only $9.67 a month per person.2 In some countries, including Rwanda, South Sudan and Mexico, tackling mental  distress at the community level has become an important part of the public health strategy. Rwanda The 1994 genocide in Rwanda has had numerous long-lasting adverse effects on mental health among citizens,  including high rates of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).3 Like other countries, Rwanda has made  efforts to address the population’s mental distress. In seeking to ensure the availability of mental health services  at the community level by 2024,4 the government has used several strategies, such as establishing mental health  facilities in all community units and health centres, enhancing the quality of mental healthcare by constructing a Na - tional Mental Health Care Center, and improving reporting and surveillance systems to manage and conduct patient  follow-ups.5 Over time the government has decentralized mental healthcare and maintained at least one psychologist  and psychiatric nurse per hospital.6 Such interventions help the people who suffer from mental disorders to heal, to  establish strong social networks at the community level and to become emotionally more resilient.7 South Sudan South Sudan’s people also struggle with mental distress, such as depression, anxiety and PTSD caused by conflict,  violence, economic hardship and poor access to healthcare, among others.8 To help people suffering from mental  distress, including those who have experienced armed conflict and violence, the International Committee of the  Red Cross’s mental health teams provide counselling services in South Sudanese health facilities such as primary  healthcare centres, physical rehabilitation centres and surgical wards.9 This approach is similar to the Rwandan one in  that it tries to leverage local public health infrastructure and trusted networks to spread access to mental healthcare. Mexico Mexico’s mental health policy involves increasing public mental health awareness, community care and outpatient  services as well as keeping the need for hospitalization to a minimum, among others.10 Specifically, to address mental  disorders, Mexico uses the community mental healthcare model, which involves developing outpatient clinics, reha - bilitation centres and sheltered homes,11 to ensure access to mental health services even in remote areas.12 Notes 1. Kohrt and others 2018.  2. MHIN 2022.  3. Rwanda Ministry of Health 2018.  4. Rwanda Ministry of Heatlh 2018.  5. Rwanda Ministry of Health  2018.  6. Smith and others 2017.  7. Hynie and others 2015.  8. ICRC 2020.  9. ICRC 2020.  10. Block and others 2020.  11. Alvarado and others  2012.  12. Block and others 2020. 90 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 constituting a psychological stressor that has been  empirically related to depression; anxiety; delinquent  behaviour; alcohol, tobacco and drug use as coping  mechanisms; metabolic disease; cardiovascular dis - ease; low birth weight; and prematurity.187 Structur - al or systemic discrimination can sometimes turn  into actual violence, going hand in hand with human  rights violations. The most extreme case is genocide,  but other forms of human rights violations and dis - respect of human dignity have left entire minority  groups, such as the Rohingya or Yazidi populations,  with serious mental health problems as well.188 Ex- clusion and discrimination can impair certain groups’  mental wellbeing, as with migrants who struggle in  adapting to the host country, specifically with cultur - al congruity, identity and even bereavement.189 Cul - turally aligned healing approaches are especially  important here, because different people believe in  different things, which may alter the effectiveness of  some mental health interventions. In the case of racism, the effect on mental well - being can be intergenerational: vicarious racism   — that is racism experienced by parents and then  transmitted to children  — can affect children’s men - tal, physical and socioemotional health (some exam - ples include increased body mass index, depression,  anxiety, substance use, delays in cognitive develop - ment and increased healthcare use for sick visits).190  This effect runs mainly through children’s increased  threat perception, harsher parenting practices, more  complicated parent–child relationships and racial  socialization  — that is the information children re - ceive about race and racism.191 Younger children are  at higher risk of developing long-term defensive pat - terns when indirectly exposed to racism (see above  about the effects of threat on long-term behaviour - al consequences). Children who are affected by dis - crimination and have insufficient psychological  resilience or resources to build it may become even  more disadvantaged with respect to their peers. Interpersonal discrimination harms societies Structural discrimination involving institutions, rules,  and norms is not the only attack on people’s digni - ty. Discrimination and exclusion among peers, col - leagues or neighbours or on the streets may also leave  psychological scars that last a lifetime if untreated. Apart from race and ethnicity people are sometimes  discriminated against due to their sexual orienta - tion or gender identity. In some countries  LGBTQI+  people have 4.5 percent stronger symptoms of de - pression and a 40 percent higher social interaction  anxiety rate than their non-LGBTQI+ counterparts.192  When minority statuses overlap  — for example, when  an LGBTQI+ person identifies as ethnic minority  —  the effects of discrimination may multiply, making  the person more vulnerable than individuals with a  single minority status.193 LGBTQI+ young people ap - pear to be especially vulnerable to discrimination  —  important, given their delicate stage of development  and identity formation. Some national surveys on this  minority group have found that: • More than 75 percent of LGBTQI+ young people  report having experienced discrimination based on  their sexual orientation or gender identity. • More than half of transgender and nonbinary  young people have seriously considered suicide  within the past year, 71 percent experienced symp - toms of anxiety disorder and roughly 62 percent  have had major depressive disorder.194 • Almost all survey participants (95 percent) report  difficulty sleeping at night, and 70 percent had felt  worthless or hopeless during the past week. • Only 26 percent of participants feel safe at school.195 The two major mental disorders are also more  common among LGBTQI+ young people, though  there is no significant variance between different eth - nic identities (figure 2.8).196 “ Mental distress caused by exclusion,  disrespect and discrimination is one more  factor that can increase multidimensional  inequalities within societies Mental distress caused by exclusion, disrespect  and discrimination is one more factor that can in - crease multidimensional inequalities within socie - ties. Where discrimination does not directly increase  health disparities, the mechanism runs through men - tal distress, which ultimately impairs physical health,  hindering people from developing their full potential  and living lives they have reason to value. These dis - advantaged people then have different conversion  factors from their peers  — and thus different capabili - ty sets (freedom to achieve) — which further increases  CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 91 multidimensional inequalities. In some cases this will  further exacerbate discrimination, exclusion and dis - respect because victims are often blamed for their dis - advantaged condition in meritocratic societies.197 It  is up to us to stand up against discrimination, protect  each other mutually in socially cohesive societies and  exercise agency when it comes to resilience building. Human development in uncertain times This chapter shows how mental stressors do not act in  a vacuum; they are interconnected and may reinforce  each other,198 particularly in the context of uncertain - ty described in chapter 1. At the same time multiple  systemic factors can help build resilience,199 as ex - plored in part II of the Report. Different sources of  toxic stress affect not only people’s mental wellbeing  but also their physical health, especially at an early  stage of the lifecycle, given that body and brain are  still developing. Child, youth and even foetal devel - opment are functions of socioeconomic, political and social structures, among many others, all of which  determine the level of adversities and distress people  are exposed to. So, individual conversion factors  —  meaning each individual’s ability to convert resourc - es into capabilities (freedom to achieve) and later into  functionings (achievements) — will vary between peo - ple and throughout the lifecycle. The intergeneration - al effect of this mechanism is remarkable due to the  strong impact of toxic stress and adversities during  pregnancy and early childhood. Mental distress can  also affect the capability set of adults, as several ex - amples throughout the chapter show. In both cases the  expansion of capabilities will be hindered, restraining  people’s choices to live lives they have reason to value.  Mental distress can thus shape individuals’ levels of  human development as well as the aggregate level of  human development of countries and regions, with  consequences for inequality within and between  countries and regions (figure 2.9). This chapter shows the implications of uncertain  times  — from economic insecurity to anthropogenic Figure 2.8 High levels of mental distress among young people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual,  transgender, queer, intersex or other sexual minority (LGBTQI+) 65% 60% 65% 65% 70% 64% 76% 71% 72% 60% 75% 68%LGBTQI+ youth who experience symptoms of: Generalized anxiety disorder Major depressive disorder By gender identity Cisgender Transgender or nonbinary By age65% 77% 70% 73% 67% 40%69%53% 13–17 18–24By race/ethnicity Asian or Paciﬁc Islander Black Latinx Native or indigenous White More than one race or ethnicity Source: The Trevor Project 2021. 92 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 pressures, digitalization, violence, discrimination  and exclusion  — for mental distress and how mental  distress can in turn constrain human development for  some people in some places, potentially increasing inequalities.

CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 93 Measuring mental wellbeing is challenging because  the concept is much wider than the mere absence  of mental disorders.1 Not all people who suffer from  mental distress develop mental disorders, and many  people do not seek professional help due to stigma or  a lack of access to mental health services (including  for lack of insurance coverage). They may thus not  identify their condition as a mental disorder.2 Hence,  numbers that count these disorders are underesti - mated. Moreover, mental wellbeing is neither binary  nor constant throughout the lifecycle. It is a complex  continuum that can comprise all sorts of stages, from  ideal wellbeing to severe emotional pain, disorienta - tion and suffering.3 Not enough is done to enhance mental wellbeing  and provide help for people who go through phases of mental distress. On average, countries spend less  than 2 percent of their healthcare budget on mental  health.4 Due to a lack of resources, inaccurate as - sessments and shortage of trained medical staff and  healthcare providers, only about 10 percent of people  worldwide who need mental health interventions re - ceive them.5 Even with partial and incomplete information on  the extent of mental disorders, the evidence shows  that they place a massive burden on every aspect  of human livelihoods  — on relationships, educa - tion, work and community participation.6 Before  the Covid-19 pandemic one person in eight world - wide, or 970 million people, suffered from a men - tal health disorder, more women than men.7 And  more than 700,000 people die by suicide each year, SPOTLIGHT 2.1 Measuring mental wellbeing — an ongoing effort Figure S2.1.1 Global prevalence of selected mental disorders, 2019 050100150200250300 Anxiety disordersDepressive disordersIdiopathic developmental intellectual disabilityAttention- deﬁcit/ hyperactivity disorderConduct disorderBipolar disorderMillions of people Men Women Note: Anxiety disorders incorporate disability caused by experiences of intense fear and distress in combination with other physiological symptoms.

Idiopathic  developmental intellectual disability captures the health loss resulting from intellectual disability that arises from any unknown source. Attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder is an externalizing disorder, incorporating disability from persistent inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity.

But  for every death by suicide there are at least 20 more  attempts, an expression of severe human suffering.8  Although more men than women die by suicide, more  women attempt suicide.9 Mental health problems are also the single lead - ing cause of disability worldwide.10 Children, ado - lescents and older people are most affected. WHO  estimates that, globally, approximately 20 percent  of children and adolescents11 and about 15 percent  of people age 60 and older suffer from mental dis - orders.12 The most common mental disorders are  anxiety (affecting 300 million people worldwide) and depression (affecting 280 million people; figure  S2.1.1).13 Most of these people live with their condi - tion without ever receiving treatment.14 Much more  work is needed to statistically embrace the concept of  mental wellbeing, develop adequate measurements  for it and offer universal services to enhance it. The cause of diagnosed mental disorders varies  with context and evolves over time, interacting with  several factors, from genes to the environment. Only  about 26 percent of the variation in anxiety15 and  37 percent of the variation in depression is due to var - iation in genes (heritability).16 For other mental dis - orders the proportion can be higher.17 This chapter  focuses on the effects of distress on mental wellbeing  for which nonheritable factors are most relevant. NOTES 1 While the literature still lacks of a clear definition of mental wellbeing, the  World Health Organization (WHO) defines mental health as “a state of  well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can  cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully,  and is able to make a contribution to her or his community” (WHO 2022b). 2 WHO 2022c. 3 UNICEF 2021c; WHO 2022c. 4 WHO 2022c. 5 PAHO 2019; WHO 2021c. 6 WHO 2021e, 2022b. 7 WHO 2022c.8 WHO 2021d, 2021f. 9 WHO 2022c. 10 PAHO 2019. 11 WHO 2021f. 12 WHO 2017. 13 IHME 2021. 14 WHO 2022c. 15 Purves and others 2020. 16 Lee and others 2013. 17 Lee and others 2013. 95 CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES SPOTLIGHT 2.2 Post-traumatic stress disorder — not just from combat Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become  known mostly as a psychological condition common  among war veterans who have returned from combat  and been severely traumatized by their experiences  on the battlefield. Less known is that PTSD is com - mon among the general population, caused by child  abuse, domestic violence, life-threatening accidents,  political violence, human rights violations and disas - ters associated with natural hazards. Trauma is “a direct personal experience of an event  that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other threat to one’s physical integrity; or  witnessing an event that involves death, injury, or a  threat to the physical integrity of another person; or  learning about unexpected or violent death, serious  harm, or threat of death or injury experienced by a  family member or other close associate.”1 A wide range of symptoms can develop (table  S2.2.1). As every human being and each traumatic  event differs, strength, duration and types of symp - toms vary among survivors. Initially, traumatic ex - periences trigger the “fight or flight” response in  Table S2.2.1 Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder among adults and children Symptoms among adults Symptoms among children  →Avoidance of thoughts, feelings or conversations  associated with the event as well as of people, places  or activities that may trigger recollections of the event  →Trauma-related thoughts or feelings (such as fear,  horror, anger, guilt or shame)  →Intrusion: Recurrent, involuntary and intrusive  recollections  →Dissociative reactions  →Inability to remember an important aspect of the event  (not due to head injury, alcohol or drugs) — usually  caused by dissociative amnesia  →Persistent and exaggerated negative beliefs  →Persistent inability to experience positive emotions  →Diminished interest or participation in activities  →All summarized as depression  →Persistent, distorted cognitions about the cause or  consequences of the event and possible blame on self  or others  →Feelings of detachment or estrangement from others  →Irritable or aggressive behaviour and angry outbursts  →Reckless or self-destructive behaviour  →Hypervigilance  →Exaggerated startle response  →Concentration problems  →Sleep disturbance (traumatic nightmares) →Affect dysregulation  →Aggression against self and others  →Unmodulated aggression and impulse control  →Dissociative symptoms (numbing, splitting, fragmentation)  →Depression  →Separation anxiety disorder  →Oppositional defiant disorder  →Phobic disorders  →Disturbed attachment patterns  →Rapid behavioural regressions and shifts in emotional states  →Loss of autonomous strivings  →Failure to achieve developmental competencies  →Altered schemas of the world  →Anticipatory behaviour and traumatic expectations  →Chronic feelings of ineffectiveness  →Impaired memory  →Diminished concentration  →Visceral dysregulation and muscular contraction  →Anxiety  →Somatization (for example, gastrointestinal distress, migraines, chronic  back conditions)  →Attentional and dissociative problems  →Difficulty negotiating relationships with caregivers, peers and,  subsequently, intimate partners  →Chronic inflammation  →Type 2 diabetes  →Obesity  →Especially with sexual assault: • Substance abuse • Borderline and antisocial personality • Eating, dissociative, affective, somatoform, cardiovascular,  metabolic, immunological and sexual disorders • The loss of bodily regulation in the areas of sleep, food and self-care • The apparent lack of awareness of danger and resulting self- endangering behaviours • Self-hatred and self-blame Source: Lengfelder (2021) based on American Psychiatric Association (2013), Center on the Developing Child (2013), Danese and Lewis (2017),  Danese and others (2014), Hackett and Steptoe (2017), Heller and LaPierre (2012) and Van der Kolk and others (2005). 96 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 the body. When this biological response is not pro - cessed, as through rapid eye movement sleep or  therapy, it remains activated in later life, when it  is no longer necessary or useful. Trauma survivors  then remain hypervigilant, with startling responses  long after the traumatic event.2 They may also de - velop depression  — persistent and exaggerated nega - tive beliefs about themselves, others and the world,  combined with an inability to experience positive  feelings and a loss of interest in activities important  before the trauma. Depressed individuals may feel  detached or estranged from others with an increas - ing feeling of isolation, exacerbating the negative  worldview.3 Some individuals tend to avoid thoughts or emo - tions related to the traumatic event, whereas others  experience especially strong emotions or thoughts re - lated to the trauma. The disproportional significance  of the trauma can impede focus on other aspects of  life. Some thoughts can be intrusive, leading to in - voluntary recollections of memory that had been lost  due to fragmentation or (partial) amnesia.4 Other  consequences may include concentration problems, sleep disturbances,5 or aggressive, reckless or self-de - structive behaviour.6 Early childhood trauma is a special case in which  the impact on daily life goes beyond the symptoms of  regular PTSD.7 Even after children are removed from  the traumatizing setting, problems with self-regula - tion, emotional adaptability, relating to others and  self-understanding may continue throughout life.8  And post-traumatic stress in early childhood is asso - ciated with obesity, chronic inflammation and type  2 diabetes.9 Chronic dissociation and partial amne - sia are two common symptoms of early childhood  trauma that can affect brain functioning and devel - opment with long-lasting consequences.10 Chronic  dissociation detaches real-life situations from emo - tions, suppressing natural responses (such as crying  when something sad happens), which are important  for mental wellbeing. Difficulty with recalling mem - ories from one’s childhood may lead to distorted  identity formation when it is unclear what happened  where, when or why during certain stages of one’s  life, and it may cause self-doubt when feeling unable  to rely on one’s own mind and memory.

CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 97  Harnessing human  development  to navigate  uncertain times PART I — UNCERTAIN TIMES, UNSETTLED LIVESCHAPTER 3 100 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022There is promise and peril in uncertainty. Tipping the  scales towards promise is up to us. But how do we do this? This chapter doubles down on human development  writ large. Wellbeing achievements matter, but more  is needed to expand people’s agency and freedoms  to help us navigate and flourish in uncertain times. This chapter also argues for widening the vista on  human behaviour, going beyond models of rational  self-interest to include emotions, cognitive biases  and the critical roles of culture.CHAPTER 3 Harnessing human development  to navigate uncertain times Enhancing human development in  uncertain times: The end, but also  the means, to navigate uncertainty Being sensitive to what is happening in the world today  implies taking notice of a novel uncertainty complex  that is unsettling people’s lives, as chapters 1 and 2 doc - umented. But uncertainty, engendering the possibility  of change, can also mobilize action and be a source of  hope. It is not that more unpredictability is better  — but  that the glaring, and often increasing, injustices pre - vailing today call for change. So does the imperative to  ease planetary pressures. They both call for transfor - mation, as does the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable De - velopment, subtitled “Transforming Our World.” Transformation is an opportunity to shape a world  that is more just for people living today and in the  future  — by addressing behavioural inadequacies and  institutional and policy gaps.1 So how are the defi - ciencies to be addressed?2 Behavioural change and  institutional and policy reform are mutually interde - pendent: institutional choices and their effectiveness  in shaping better outcomes are contingent on behav - iours and on varying social, economic, political and  cultural circumstances.3 The interaction of behav - iours and institutions is shaped by public reasoning  and procedures of social choice (figure 3.1).4 Given  that outcomes are contingent on behaviour and cir - cumstances, how can social choice be shaped so that  it advances a transformation to a more just world  while easing planetary pressures? This is where doubling down on human develop - ment comes in. Advancing human development, the aspiration behind every Human Development Re - port, is not only the end but also the means for peo - ple to strive for change that leads to better outcomes  by harnessing diverse and plural views in productive  ways. Human development is about expanding capa - bilities, so equitably expanding capabilities is central  in assessing development progress and evaluating  policies.5 Capabilities are not exhausted with wellbeing  achievements. One key distinction relates to the dif - ference between advancing a person’s wellbeing and  promoting a person’s agency (spotlight 3.1; see also  spotlight 3.2). Doubling down on human development (wellbeing  and agency) opens the space to explore options to  shape our future. Many institutions are designed and  policies implemented based on specific behavioural  assumptions (that people are rational only if they pur - sue the maximization of their individual wellbeing  while assuming that everyone else is doing the same).  But it is possible to draw on a richer understanding  of human behaviour and motivation.6 Central to the  human development approach is the emphasis on  people’s ability to participate individually and collec - tively in public reasoning — subjecting prevalent be - liefs and purported reasons to critical examination  and retaining those to be sustained after doing so. The pursuit of human development recognizes  that people have plural identities and affiliations and  value a plurality of dimensions, often simultaneously.  Broadening the vista of how people behave, briefly re - viewed below, suggests how an approach centred on  the pursuit of human development may be the means  to navigate uncertainty. Human development lever - ages a richer understanding of how people behave as  well as the potential for social choice, through indi - vidual and public scrutiny of beliefs and reasons, to  marshal institutions and public policies that advance  justice while easing planetary pressures. How to do so  in practice is the subject of part II of the Report. Widening the vista of human behaviour Many institutional designs and policy recommen - dations assume that people behave as “rational”7  agents (see spotlight 3.3). Much can be accomplished  by using this assumption to descriptively under - stand many social and economic processes and to Figure 3.1 Behavioural change and institutional reform are  mutually dependent Interactions are mutually  dependent and based  on public reasoning  and procedures of  social choiceBehavioural changeInstitutional policy change Source: Human Development Report Office. CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 101 normatively clarify the implications of different so - cial choices (column 1 in table 3.1). But descriptively,  this assumption corresponds to a very limited way of  representing how people make choices. For instance,  it poses very high demands on people’s cognitive  processing power, which has long motivated alter - native framings of bounded rationality.8 It also corre - sponds to a very narrow understanding of the role of  the social context,9 which has motivated arguments  specifying how social embeddedness matters.10 The  explosion of behavioural economics and behaviour - al science has documented many deviations in ac - tual human behaviour from what this assumption  would predict.11 The role of emotions, and how peo - ple come to reach and stick to beliefs, has also been  increasingly explored. This has provided a broader  framework for understanding human behaviour and  why it sometimes seems hard for people to act indi - vidually and collectively in the face of uncertainty.  This broader understanding widens the set of justi - fications and inspiration for policies and institutions  (column 2 in table 3.1). The human development approach’s considera - tion of agency alongside wellbeing highlights the  relevance of expanding beyond the assumption that  choices are driven exclusively by the pursuit of the  welfare of individuals, interest groups or countries  —  recognizing that this pursuit does matter and often  dominates.12 But it need not be the exclusive driv - er of choice. Amartya Sen described people who are  assumed to always exclusively pursue egoistically individual payoffs while assuming that everyone else  is doing the same as “rational fools,”13 because mu - tual choices based on this assumption often lead to  suboptimal outcomes for all involved.14 He argued  further that elements such as the choice process (in - cluding the menu of available options to choose from)  and the fact that choices may have to be made even if  a judgment has not been fully completed also point to  a richer set of determinants of choice than maximiz - ing individual material interests. That opens space  for “the sociological exploration of the complex val - ues that influence people’s conduct.”15 Recent evidence from cognitive neuroscience nu - ances the commonly held view that what people  value is simply what gives them happiness, rewards  or pleasantness. People can value something because  of the goals they are pursuing, and these goals (and  therefore, what they value) can change with circum - stances (for example, a compass is more important  than a diamond for someone lost in the desert). This  goal-  dependent usefulness is critical in guiding be - haviour and constructing value  — and is particularly  important when circumstances change.16 But what  people value is not only associated with need; it can  also be the result of notions of responsibility.17 The  notion of responsibility could be influenced by so - cial norms of conduct or individual ethical reflection  but takes us to the realm of agency. In particular, Sen  argued that responsibility could be crucial in what  he called the “operation of ‘environmental values,’  which is one of the reasons why the market analogy  Table 3.1 Behavioural assumptions: Determinants and scope of interventions to shape choices “Rational” agent Behavioural agent Encultured agent Individual  determinants of  choicePreferences (stable, autonomous);  beliefs (isolated from preferences,  based on collecting and processing  information)Preferences (can be fickle),  beliefs (can be motivated),  plus emotions (can change  preferences and beliefs)Preferences, beliefs, emotions  shaped by social constructs  (cultural mental models) Cognition Maximizes utility and assumes  everyone else is doing the sameCognitive limitations and biases  (endowment effect) universal  and hardwired, social context  (norms, social preferences)Culture shapes psychological  traits; culture contingent on  context and evolving over time Social determinants of  choicePrices, rules of the game (emerge  from a unique equilibrium)Prices, rules of the game, plus  social context (norms, framing  of choices)Experience and exposure to  culture, which creates mental  models (categories) Scope of actions to  shape choicesIncentives to correct market failures  (externalities), governance (improve  the rules of the game)Incentives, governance, plus  choice architecture (nudge,  prime), social normsIncentives, governance, social  context, plus social identities,  worldviews, narratives (which  prime certain behaviours) Source: Human Development Report Office based on Hoff and Stiglitz (2016). 102 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 is often quite deceptive in assessing ‘existence values’  of what people try actively to preserve in nature.”18 “  People tend to make choices under what is  called narrow framing. That is, they do not  evaluate all possible outcomes and weigh them  against one another but focus on one or a few  that are more salient for different reasons The insights briefly reviewed here are not new, but  today’s uncertain times make them more relevant  —  and may, in fact, call for completely new analytical  tools (spotlight 3.4; see also spotlight 3.5). Going be - yond the “rational” agent and the behavioural agent  and recognizing the role of the broader social con - text in shaping people’s choices gets us to the encul - tured agent (column 3 in table 3.1).19 This provides an  even wider scope of interventions, one that includes  a more prominent account of the role of the social  context and the potential of widening ways of inter - vening to confront today’s uncertain times. In build - ing this argument, the chapter explains the relevance  of the human development approach to seize that  potential. A psychologically richer description  of behaviour under uncertainty One example where the deviations of the rational  choice model matters for the analysis in this Report  relates to how people make choices under uncertain - ty. In many cases choices appear to be based on the  evaluation of changes in wellbeing from a certain ref - erence point,20 as opposed to being based on the eval - uation of levels of wellbeing.21 There might be a deep  biological and cognitive foundation for this,22 given  that human perceptual systems are broadly adaptive:  what we find cold or hot or bright or dark is driven in  part by a contrast with a frame of reference, typically  our recent experience with temperature or light.23 People often seem to give greater weight to loss - es than gains when making choices. That is, they are  often more reluctant to choose an outcome where  there is a chance of losing $100 than one where there  is the same chance of gaining the same amount — loss  aversion.24 This can account for the status quo bias,25  or the endowment effect, where people ask for more compensation to sell something they already own  than what they would be willing to pay if they did not  own it yet — a rational agent would have no reason to  value the same thing differently.26 A related behav - iour is probability weighting, where people attribute  a higher probability to events that have actually very  low probability of occurring (say, winning the lottery),  while assuming that events with very high probability  of occurring are less likely than they are in reality.27 Something that sociologists have emphasized for a  long time is that people often look at money as some - thing other than a fungible and homogeneous flow  of income. In many cases they construct mental ac - counts attributing different meanings and values to  different flows of income depending on factors rang - ing from how the money was earned to what it was  meant for.28 Money also serves different functions,  from offering for a sense of autonomy to being val - ued for the security that it provides for the future,  which can vary across cultural contexts and across  the income distribution.29 Finally  — and the list could  go on even for this narrow set of behaviours linked  to choice under uncertainty  — people tend to make  choices under what is called narrow framing.30 That  is, they do not evaluate all possible outcomes and  weigh them against one another but focus on one or  a few that are more salient for different reasons (be - cause they are surprising, say).31 To illustrate how this set of deviations from the  rational choice model can matter in the context of  changes to address the challenges discussed in this  Report, imagine the following scenario. A policy- maker shows how existing fossil fuel subsidies are  inefficient and regressive, are polluting the air and  could be phased out and replaced by income trans - fers or public spending on health and education, at  the same time giving incentives for less energy-in - tensive investments and innovations that help to fight  climate change.32 How would a behavioural agent look at the pro - posal? Possible deviations from rational choice (in - terlinked, not necessarily sequential and separate)  include the following. First, the subsidy becomes sali - ent (the agent might not even have known before that  something like this was in place) and a primary focus  of valuation (narrow framing). Second, the endow - ment effect would suggest that the behavioural agent  is not inclined to simply accept losing something she  CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 103 already has. Third, as appealing as the potential gains  from the policy are to the climate change–aware be - havioural agent, loss aversion can dominate, and the  prospective gains might not compensate for the pro - spective losses.33 Fourth, mental accounts mean that  all the money may already be destined for purposes  and goals from which the agent will not want to de - viate. Fifth, even though the policymaker is of unim - peachable integrity and very likely to follow through  with the compensation scheme, probability weight - ing could come to the fore, leading the behavioural  agent to believe that it is not that likely. “ Now widely recognized and accepted,  cognitive biases have opened a much  richer understanding of human behaviour  and a wider scope for the range of  policies and institutions that may be  considered beyond those that emanate  from the rational choice model At a minimum the behavioural agent could be ex - pected to be less supportive, if not outright oppose,  phasing out the fossil fuel subsidy, independent  of political economy and framing effects. In reali - ty, powerful economic interests seek to sway pub - lic opinion against removing fossil fuel subsidies to  keep their economic and political power,34 possibly  crafting narratives that build on some of these be - havioural insights. The scenario does not imply that  the behavioural agent is beyond the reach of reason:  each of the steps could be critically scrutinized, even  if this could be complex and cognitively demanding.  Nor is it inevitable that everyone will oppose the re - moval of fossil fuel subsidies  — quite the contrary, as  the discussion below suggests. This scenario is meant  simply to illustrate how a psychologically richer de - scription of behaviour under uncertainty opens space  to consider a wider scope beyond material incentives  to shape people’s choices.35 Now widely recognized and accepted, cognitive  biases (with reference to what would be expected  behaviour as a “rational” agent) and cognitive lim - itations (people are unable to process as much in - formation as would need to happen under a rational  choice model) have opened a much richer under - standing of human behaviour. This understanding  can widen the range of policies and institutions that may be considered beyond those that emanate from  the rational choice model. The implications contin - ue to be explored in fields ranging from optimal tax - ation36 to issues that draw on progress in behavioural  economics as an example of the “golden age of social  science.”37 Prospect theory (which accounts for sever - al of the biases associated with behaviour under un - certainty)38 has been used for insights from politics39  to international relations.40 This has inspired policy  interest in “nudging” or “priming” interventions that  preserve the freedom of choice but change the choice  architecture in ways that seek to “correct” for cogni - tive biases.41 These nonfiscal and nonregulatory ac - tions steer people to behave in a certain way but fully  preserve freedom of choice. One example is the Save  More Tomorrow initiative, behavioural interventions  nudging people to save more, whose principles have  been incorporated in the United States’ 2006 Pen - sion Protection Act.42 No single unified model accounts for all the docu - mented cognitive biases.43 So an intervention seek - ing to address one type of bias may affect behaviour  in a negative way elsewhere.44 Some behavioural in - terventions can even become too salient and back - fire, such as displaying death counts in street signs  to encourage safer driving, which has been shown to  increase car crashes.45 Nudges aim at intervening in  situations where people think fast and automatically,  implying that they make decisions in a different way  from when they are able to think slowly and reflec - tively.46 But this dichotomy may imply that opportu - nities are missed by recognizing that it is possible to  incorporate elements of reflection even in nudges47 or  to boost people’s ability to make decisions, enhanc - ing their agency in making choices.48 The effective - ness of nudges and boosts may also vary depending  on the cultural context.49 More than reviewing all relevant biases and their  implications, the purpose here is to suggest that cog - nitive biases and limitations often shape how people  behave, particularly in contexts of uncertainty. But  that behaviour, even if it deviates from what the ra - tional choice model predicts, does not imply that peo - ple are lacking in reason  — much of the behaviour may  actually be preferable, particularly to deal with un - certainty.50 Thus, awareness of these considerations  has heightened relevance when confronting uncer - tainties. A promising development with potentially  104 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 far-reaching policy implications is identifying funda - mental cognitive processes that can account for many  of the observed behavioural choices under uncertain - ty (spotlight 3.6). When emotions make preferences fickle The emotion of fear  — triggered by the belief of a  threat — tends to make people more risk averse, while  anger tends to make them more risk seeking.51 This  is just an example of how beliefs can change prefer - ences through emotions.52 Rational choice theory  assumes not only that beliefs and preferences both  matter but also that they are delinked. Emotions re - sult from gathering information, learning and ex - perience.53 Thinking and feeling are simultaneous  processes that cognitively shape an individual’s per - ception, attention, learning, memory, reasoning and  problem solving — affecting even the direction of cog - nitive biases. For instance, sadness  — growing glob - ally over the last decade, with more intensity among  the less educated  — often reverses the endowment  effect: when people are sad, choice prices exceed  selling prices (figure 3.2).54 Sadness can also height - en addictive substance use.55 In addition, anger can  account for major changes in political history that rational choice alone cannot explain,56 and emotions  more broadly can be decisive in accounts of historical  action and thought.57 Hope can lead to choices that  enhance health58 and mediate the relation between  income and subjective measures of wellbeing.59 The relevance of emotions seems to have deep  neuro-anatomical foundations, as seen in the way  people with different types of brain injuries make de - cisions.60 Recent neuroscience findings suggest that  rational decisionmaking may depend on prior accu - rate emotional processing.61 Even though some of the  specific findings may not be conclusive,62 a growing  body of evidence documents multiple ways that emo - tions matter when making choices,63 generating “the  rise of affectivism.”64 A full emotion-imbued model  of choice has been proposed.65 An instinctive sentiment of anger that can trig - ger a risky course of action  — which, in insight and  after critical reasoning is seen as harmful to oneself  or others  — can be dangerous. By contrast, emotions  are often triggered by reasoned understanding of  connections  — for instance, the cause of manifest in - justice that makes one angry about discrimination or  torture. Angry rhetoric in the writings of Mary Woll - stonecraft in the 19th century against the inequalities  suffered by women was followed by a strong appeal to  reason for the equality of rights of all human beings.66  Figure 3.2 People are experiencing more sadness 35 30 25 20 15Adult population experiencing sadness last day, by education level  (%, median across country values) 2005 2010 2015 2020Elementary school or less Less than tertiary education Tertiary complete Source: Human Development Report Office based on data from Gallup. CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 105 That emotions matter for behaviour is not, however,  a negation of rationality or reason or a justification for  not subjecting emotions to reasoned appraisal in the  same way that motivations and beliefs need to be. Motivated beliefs and motivated reasoning: When  more and better information may not be enough Preferences, goals and motivations can directly affect  beliefs, as a rapidly growing literature on motivated  beliefs and motivated reasoning documents  — people  distort how they process new information in the di - rection of beliefs they favour.67 In rational choice, be - liefs are based on rationally processing information,  and people cannot be systematically fooled. But be - liefs also fulfil psychological and other needs, with  implications for behaviour and choice. One example of motivated reasoning is wishful  thinking, which seems to have a positive valence  value, making people feel better and more optimistic  about the world, thus also having an emotional com - ponent. But it also has a functional value, allowing  people to persist in a task under adversity.68 Howev - er, it may also support dangerous behaviours, such as  persisting in smoking, believing that one’s health will  not be affected, despite all the scientific evidence to  the contrary.69 Beliefs about oneself or the world can persist de - spite information that would suggest (in a rational  choice model) the need to update beliefs. Such per - sistence can take place through many mechanisms  of self-deception or dissonance reduction.70 The pro - pensity to rationalize away evidence that clashes with  beliefs has been documented to be higher in some  instances for more analytically sophisticated and bet - ter educated individuals, so one cannot assume that  the importance of motivated cognition will decrease  as levels of education increase.71 Evidence also sug - gests that motivated reasoning is persistent in politi - cal leaders, who rely more on prior political attitudes  and less on new policy information than the general  public.72 Challenging beliefs that are deeply held be - cause they are associated with a person’s goals or  commitments  — for example, religious, moral or a  salient aspect of a person’s identity or politics  — can  trigger strong emotional responses of anger or even hate and disgust.73 Motivated reasoning can lead to  beliefs becoming more polarized around issues such  as immigration, income mobility and how to handle  crime.74 That is, some of the cleavages in beliefs are  tied not necessarily to material interests but to differ - ent worldviews or social identity. And when these ac - quire more salience, polarization can become more  correlated across issues, leading to “belief-value  constellations,”75 where people associate more with  a group based on shared ideas rather than economic  interests.76 “ Recognizing motivated beliefs can provide  a broader understanding not only of economic  choices but also of social and political  dynamics that cannot be accounted for by  assuming that voters and pressure groups  pursue their material self-interest and update  their beliefs on the basis of new evidence One illustration of the potential implications of  motivated reasoning is associated with (epistemic)  norms that shape what people consider to be true, in  addition to individual reasoning.77 Children at very  young age (age 4, with some rudimentary aspects  emerging during infancy) can determine beliefs that  are the norm in their context and identify false beliefs  — according to the prevailing social norm.78 Different  groups may assume different epistemic norms that  place different levels of trust on different sources of  information, institutions, experts and leaders. Indi - viduals may publicly reject or avoid certain behav - iours (for instance, attitudes towards vaccines or the  use of masks to avoid the spread of Covid-19)79 to sig - nal their commitment to a particular group and the  belief-value constellation that it holds.80 This may  “create a tension between epistemic norms that reli - ably lead to true beliefs and those that effectively per - form […] signaling functions associated with social  identity and group membership.”81 Thus, recognizing motivated beliefs can provide a  broader understanding not only of economic choices  but also of social and political dynamics that cannot  be accounted for by assuming that voters and pres - sure groups pursue their material self-interest and  update their beliefs on the basis of new evidence.82  Another very compelling application of motivated be - liefs could be how people may convince themselves  106 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 that climate change is not going to be too bad purely  because it helps them justify not taking action.83 Un - derstanding motivated reasoning provides a lens to  understand some dynamics of polarization noted in  chapter 1 and explored further in part II of the Re - port. How goals and values can motivate beliefs may  be relevant when we confront novel uncertainties  and particularly when there is a reversal in the impor - tance given in public debate to sentiments rather than  reasons. Since the 1980s there has been a reversal in  a trend dating from the mid-19th century of rational  language dominating sentiment-laden language in  fact-based argument (figure 3.3).84This evidence does not suggest that beliefs are  never or even infrequently updated based on new in - formation. But it shows how motivated cognition can  provide a richer understanding of human behaviour.85  It also shows that polarization should not be seen as  inevitable and preordained  — and that the affirma - tion of a more salient social identity, above all others,  should not be seen to uniquely define a person and  thus be accepted without scrutiny.86 Even more im - portant from a human development perspective, indi - vidual reasoning and public deliberation are powerful  drivers of social change  — people are not helpless pris - oners of one single social identity, of their emotions  Figure 3.3 The Great Reversal from rationality to sentiment in fact-based argument [average frequency of rationality word s] / [average frequency of intuition words] 0.40.60.81.01.2 A.

Indeed, harnessing diversity  of goals, motivations, values, beliefs and emotions  depends on how behaviours interact with institutions  and the procedures of social choice that can harness  plurality in productive ways, as explored next. Behavioural and institutional change:  Mobilizing human development  towards a hopeful future As argued earlier, behavioural changes and institu - tional reforms are interdependent. And the richer  understanding of human behaviour just reviewed  suggests much more scope for change in both than  may be commonly assumed. This is central to explore  how to draw from a context of uncertainty to mobilize  action towards a more hopeful future. That scope ex - pands even further with the understanding that cog - nitive biases and limitations are not hardwired and  universal to all humans in the same way87 — and are  not necessarily an inherent part of our psychology.88  Similarly, the role of emotions in changing preferenc - es and driving behaviour is also context contingent.  Emotions play a role in people’s conforming with so - cial norms, but the salience of doing so to avoid either  shame or guilt depends on the cultural context.89 It  has been argued that socialization and cultural con - text determine which emotions matter for behaviour  and how.90 And preferences and the motivations that  may drive certain beliefs  — across domains, from at - titudes towards risk to preferences for equity and in - come distribution  — vary widely across individuals  and across countries.91 Bringing culture back in: How the social context matters Recognizing culture (discussed below) is only part  of a broader and more fundamental point: the need  to give greater salience to how social contexts shape  preferences, perceptions and cognition  — not only  what people do but also who people believe they are.  That takes us from the rational agent and beyond the  behavioural agent to the encultured agent (see table  3.1).92 Recent insights from sociology have recon - ceptualized culture from something that stays in the  background of political and economic life towards  a much more dynamic, fluid and adaptable toolkit. This implies a two-way causal effect between cul - ture and institutions.93 It also means that people se - lect strategically from the toolkit to provide meaning,  interpretation and justification for their behaviour.94  Studies of poverty that focus on how scarcity taxes  people’s cognitive capacities and functions95 would  benefit from considering how people perceive and  identify needs based on what they take from the cul - tural toolkit available to them.96 When uncertainty  becomes salient, different groups of young people  buffer themselves against a murky future in differ - ent ways, drawing on the cultural toolkits available  to them.97 This perspective on culture is inspiring  fresh takes on economic development, exploring how  highly adaptable and fluid cultural configurations in - teract with political power and economic incentives  to generate different social, economic and political  outcomes.98 An emerging account of how cultural variation  takes hold comes from the field of cultural evolution,99  even if it remains a hotly debated perspective.100 In  this account psychological traits coevolve with the  broader cultural context in combinations that make  societies better adapted to different circumstanc - es over time.101 These perspectives also suggest that  what is assumed to be universal human behaviour is  often based on what is observed from a sliver of hu - manity.102 Thus, there is a much broader diversity of  behaviours, psychology and institutions across the  world and over time. And there is even more variation  within than across cultures.103 “ Recognizing culture is only part of a  broader and more fundamental point: the  need to give greater salience to how social  contexts shape preferences, perceptions  and cognition  — not only what people do  but also who people believe they are Culture, in these accounts, “represents informa - tion stored in people’s heads that got there through  cultural learning or direct experience induced by  various cultural products, like norms, technologies,  languages or institutions.”104 Cultures can vary in sys - tematic ways on dimensions ranging from how tight  cultural norms are enforced105 to how individualistic  they are.106 But cultures cannot be firmly categorized  in different boxes  — and even less so in dichotomous  108 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 ways, such as associating individualistic cultures with  “the West” and interdependent cultures with “the  East.”107 In cultural evolution accounts, cultural change is  driven largely by the emergence of culture and psy - chological traits that are better adapted to cope with  the new environment.108 Over time this has resulted  in culture-psychology combinations that have ena - bled people to cooperate at larger scales  — millions of  strangers in today’s societies  — devising specific social  arrangements (institutions, policies) resulting in ever  more complex and sophisticated technologies, lead - ing to higher income and material wellbeing.109 Cul - tural evolution is one way of accounting for changes  in moral values, with variations around the world as - sociated in part with how different societies have re - sponded to the problem of cooperation.110 A mismatch of behavioural patterns and  institutional settings in today’s uncertain times? Culture is both persistent, which helps people nav - igate and make decisions in their social world, and  changeable, particularly when that social world or the  environment around it is altered.111 When uncertainty  is heightened or changes, the potential for a cultural  mismatch increases between those relying on pre - vailing culture and those attempting to innovate to  adapt to the new circumstances.112 Cultural change  can play a role in how the social context influences  the emergence of behaviour and institutional config - urations. But as Amartya Sen argued: “Paying reflec - tive ethical attention to behaviour neither nullifies,  nor is nullified by, the importance of evolutionary  forces.”113 Ethical reasoning has been described as a  powerful way of “escaping from tribalism,” manifest  in patterns of moral progress that are less and less ex - clusionary of groups of people.114 It also offers oppor - tunities for norm-based governance to address global  collective action challenges, such as climate change.115 Evolutionary processes and ethical reasoning may  have interacted in reaching the current prevailing  configurations of behaviours and institutions. But  today’s uncertain times have novel elements that  present fundamentally new challenges, and those  configurations may not be a good match. Some of  the challenges of the Anthropocene are existential; others require cooperation not only with people alive  today but also with people who do not yet exist —  that is, with the future.116 The Anthropocene reality  of shared challenges at the planetary scale requires  cooperation  — or, at a minimum, coordination  —  across countries. “ There is tension between conforming to  the prevailing institutions (including norms)  and behaviours that have moved the world  towards record achievements in material  wellbeing  — and the lack of response from  those norms, institutions and behaviours  to a novel and unprecedented context Individual solutions for shared challenges can cre - ate tensions between self-reliance and collective effi - ciency. One country or group of people may be able to  afford to stay protected from a pandemic through pri - vate means. That can make cooperation and even co - ordination more difficult, in a modern tragedy of the  commons.117 Certainty about biophysical thresholds  of climate change and other dangerous patterns of  planetary change that would spell catastrophe would  make coordination by self-  interested agents more  likely. But great uncertainty about those thresholds  makes collective action less likely and harder.118 So, today’s uncertain times may be characterized  in part as a mismatch between the cultural configu - rations that have enabled certain development paths  thus far119 and the layered novel uncertainties of the  Anthropocene, transitions and polarization. Disa - greements and even conflict in societies may reflect  that mismatch. There is tension between conform - ing to the prevailing institutions (including norms)  and behaviours that have moved the world towards  record achievements in material wellbeing — and the  lack of response from those norms, institutions and  behaviours to a novel and unprecedented context. This mismatch could be playing out in many di - mensions. One has to do with generational inequal - ities in exposure to climate extremes. For the cohort  born in 1960, exposure to lifetime heat waves is es - sentially the same across climate change scenari - os. But even if temperatures stay below 1.5°C above  preindustrial levels, the cohort born in 2020 will  suffer four times more exposure  — and seven times  more under current pledges (figure 3.4). No surprise,  CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 109 then, that young people ages 16–25 around the world  report associating climate change with a range of  emotions with negative affect, from anger to anxie - ty: two-thirds report feeling sad, and two-thirds re - port feeling afraid.120 Another facet of disagreement  is the differences across groups of people in either  doubting or denying climate change. Groups in Eu - rope more concerned about their economic security  and less certain about the future are much more like - ly to reject climate change  — and to be “less prosper - ous, more rural and more economically dependent  on fossil fuels.”121 And individualistic attitudes are  associated with less concern for environmental ac - tion122 and less wearing of masks during the Covid-19  pandemic.123 The potential of this mismatch, and the broader  range of determinants of human behaviour beyond  rational and behavioural agents, also opens opportu - nities to mobilize uncertain times for better individ - ual and social outcomes. The insights from rational  choice and the emphasis on incentives remain rele - vant. Understanding how the context in the moment of decision influences choices, one of the insights of  behavioural science, and the role of emotions and  motivated reasoning widens the scope beyond incen - tives shaping the choices of self-interested agents.  But recognizing the role of culture further widens the  scope. It takes us beyond considering how interests  and institutions drive people’s behaviour, to recog - nize the power of ideas.124 Ideas with the power to shape individual and col - lective choice range from social identities and world - views125 to narratives and frames.126 Joel Mokyr has  emphasized “cultural entrepreneurs” as agents able  to change the beliefs of others during momentous  transformations in history, such as during the En - lightenment and the Industrial Revolution.127 Car - oline Schill and colleagues argue that this more  “dynamic understanding of human behaviour” is es - sential in the Anthropocene.128 This Report extends the argument to today’s un - certain times.129 It looks at current disagreements  and differences in perspective across groups of peo - ple less as a motive for despair and more as the kind  of diversity and pluralism that may be needed in an  open-ended pursuit of the innovations  — social, tech - nological, institutional  — required to respond to novel  and unprecedented challenges. In the “paradox of di - versity,” this pursuit may require longer lead times to  agree on collective actions and implement collective  decisions.130 As David Byrne sings: “The future is cer - tain; give us time to work it out.” This paradox gives  even more reason to address inequalities perceived  as unfair or divisive, while preserving the plurality of  views and an open, reasoned, public debate.131 Advancing human development to learn, and to  expand the scope for learning, in uncertain times Chapter 1 documented how novel layers of interact - ing uncertainties are heightening feelings of insecu - rity,132 pointing to a disconnect between wellbeing  achievements and security. What do we hold on to,  then, when even our sense of direction seems sub - merged in uncertainty? Wellbeing achievements with  insecurity and progress with polarization133 cast doubt  on seeing development as a smooth process of pro - gress in wellbeing achievements.

Our planet and  societies have gone through periods of change and  volatility before. But one key feature making this era  unique is humans’ role in driving threats  — and our  potential ability to shape the changes to build a more  hopeful future (spotlight 3.7).135 A real paradox of our  time is our tentativeness to act despite mounting evi - dence of the distress that our pursuit of development  is inflicting on our societies and planet. One contri - bution of this Report is to explore how understanding  uncertainty and its relation to individual and collec - tive choices can explain why action may be delayed,  even in the face of looming threats, and to suggest  ways forward that move us beyond paralysis.136 Why might societies not adequately respond to  uncertainty? Consider the interaction between the  different multilayered uncertainties and both behav - iour and institutions (figure 3.5). Societies respond  to shocks through multiple institutional and policy  mechanisms. These institutions are often designed  to absorb the shocks and moderate the threats that  people confront. Under the rational choice model this  process depends on state capacity, resource distribu - tion and social preferences, as with the way societies manage the potential tensions between social insur - ance and individual responsibility.137 Now consider how social arrangements (insti - tutions and policies) are influenced by a wider set  of individual and social factors interacting with an  evolving reality. In the presence of new threats, peo - ple’s behaviour is strongly mediated by their per - ceived uncertainty.138 This perception comes through  different channels. First is the increase in residual  uncertainty, the one not absorbed by the collective  response. Second is the perceived adequacy of the  social response and the extent to which previous be - liefs about how things work hold, which determines  confidence in institutions and trust within and across  groups. Third is the social and cultural context that  defines the interpretation of the new threats in the  light of prevailing narratives. Is it a sign of personal  failure? Will this affect my position and future pros - pects in society?139 Fourth are the emotions surround - ing the increased uncertainty, ranging from fear to  indifference to hope. The same shock can thus cause  different levels of perceived individual uncertainty,  depending on the prevailing narratives about under - lying processes and the perceived effectiveness of  policies. Uncertainty for individuals shapes both individu - al behaviour and attitudes, with an impact on social  interactions. Collective responses to uncertainty that  Figure 3.5 Individual and collective responses to uncertainty can drive uncertainty loops Inﬂuence Behaviour patternsInstitutions and policies Trigger Individual perceptions of uncertaintyAttitudes  towards public  reasoning and social choiceResidual threats for people exposed Thoughts, preferences, beliefs, emotions and their social context Source: Human Development Report Office. CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 111 are perceived as ineffective or unfair can trigger an - imosity and polarization  — especially in the presence  of political narratives that manipulate the situation to  deepen societal divides.140 Such polarization has been  documented in several countries in the response to  the Covid-19 pandemic,141 where the public health  measures put in place were resisted less because of  a personal assessment of risks of, for instance, being  vaccinated, and more because they represented a set  of behaviours that defined expected group behav - iours. Disbelief in climate change is associated more  with political allegiance than with misinformation.142  This animosity and polarization then drive not only  the specific collective response but also how the col - lective response interacts with the threat, eventually  heightening uncertainty. Thus, the high and in many  cases rising perceptions of insecurity may be ac - counted for in this type of uncertainty loop. Expanding human development to foster  learning and public reasoning The broader understanding of human behaviour  highlighted in this chapter helps account for some of  the choices that so many people are making around  the world, resulting in patterns ranging from political  polarization to the rejection or dilution of the science  of climate change and pandemics. But understand - ing does not mean resignation. Recognizing the role  of emotions does not mean that we should wait until  catastrophic outcomes become emotionally salient to  act. Events that become salient and emotionally res - onant can drive action, sometimes in directions that  were thought to be unthinkable before that event.143  But the layers of uncertainty described in chapter 1  imply that we have no option other than to think  ahead and act with a sense of urgency, since in many  cases we will not have second chances.144 And understanding that people are often prey to  motivated reasoning and hold steadfast to beliefs  that are hard to dislodge145 is no reason to not scruti - nize reasons and beliefs. Subjecting prevailing beliefs  and alleged reasons to critical examination, through  appropriately comprehensive processes (see below)  and with relevant information, can result in objective  beliefs. Indeed, research has shown that uncertain - ty about other people’s political beliefs and attitudes can drive people to tighten their own beliefs.146 Be- cause people often misconceive others’ attitudes and  values, polarization may be cemented in spaces and  on issues where differences in attitudes or opinions  are, in fact, fairly small.147 This so-called “false polar - ization” has been found to drive actual political po - larization.148 Understanding the processes that create  misconceptions opens space for interventions that  may correct them and mitigate political polarization.149 “ Subjecting prevailing beliefs and  alleged reasons to critical examination,  through appropriately comprehensive  processes and with relevant information,  can result in objective beliefs This scrutiny of reasons and beliefs should happen  at the individual level, but here we have to be mindful  also of the cognitive limitations and biases discussed  earlier in the chapter (see also spotlight 3.6). That is  why public reasoning — always important under any  circumstances  — acquires heightened relevance in to - day’s world. Our individual brains are limited, but our  collective brain150 is far more powerful. A plurality of  sources of voice and power is not a weakness in to - day’s uncertain times but can be a source of strength,  provided processes sustained by democratic practic - es ensure that public reasoning takes place in a con - text and through processes where what carries the  day is not always a powerful economic or political  group or a highly motivated believer who refuses to  subject beliefs to critical examination.151 Processes of  democratic practice, at multiple scales, need to also  avoid parochial dominance and welcome perspec - tives from “impartial spectators” — that is, the views  of people who may not be part of a particular political  jurisdiction. And given that the novel layers of uncer - tainty have planetary relevance, the role of multilat - eralism becomes more relevant than ever.152 So what to do? Part II of the Report addresses this  question, but as part I closes, it is important to reaf - firm the central argument of this chapter, that dou - bling down on human development is not only the  central aspiration but also the means to navigate un - certain times and effect the behavioural changes and  institutional reforms that would allow us to shape  a more hopeful future. Advancing human develop - ment means pursuing all aspects of capabilities, not  112 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 just the drive to enhance wellbeing achievements.  Agency matters, as do freedoms in both wellbeing  and agency  — options that need to remain wide as  the search for the appropriate set of institutions and  behaviours is still open-ended. In a sense expand - ing human development in uncertain times can also  be a learning process, where capabilities  — wellbeing  and agency, achievements and freedoms  — allow for  changes in behaviour and institutions to take shape  in addition to expanding the scope for learning. Con - fronting the layers of uncertainty that we face today is about enhancing cooperation at multiple scales  and about the “agility of the mind” to use new and  appropriate frames to understand our world and the  responses needed to address the challenges that we  confront.153 Part II of the Report proposes motivating princi - ples whose cultivation can enable public reasoning,  as well as priority policy areas, so that human devel - opment is advanced in a way that enables people to  harness uncertainty towards a more hopeful world  —  more just for people living now and in the future. CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 113 Agency is the ability to hold values and make com - mitments that may  — or may not — advance the per - son’s wellbeing.1 The person may be committed to  fighting climate change to an extent that she skips  school or forgoes a well-paying job, choices that  may not advance wellbeing but would express agen - cy. Another important distinction is between actual  achievements and the options or freedoms available  to people, regardless of their choices. Independent of  what people end up securing, the options or freedoms  available to people are inherently valuable.2 These distinctions result in four aspects of capabil - ities of interest: • Achievements in wellbeing. • Achievements in agency. • Freedoms in wellbeing. • Freedoms in agency.3 In assessing development progress, the spotlight  tends to shine more on wellbeing achievements, such  as standards of living, and much less on the freedoms  available to people and their agency.4 But these four aspects of capabilities are relevant  in the context of drawing on the human development  approach to support behavioural change and insti - tutional reform to navigate today’s uncertain times.  Chapters 1 and 2 suggest the need to go beyond  —  not replace  — considering wellbeing achievements  alone  — for two reasons. First, the spotlight on well - being achievements may leave other aspects of life  that matter to people in the shadows  — such as feeling very or increasingly insecure, despite high wellbeing  achievements. Second, there is no guarantee that fo - cusing on wellbeing achievements alone would equip  people with the capabilities to navigate today’s un - certain times  — and particularly to lead fundamental  transformational change to adapt and transition away  from the layers of novel uncertainty that characterize  today’s world. Freedoms and agency have always been intrinsical - ly important. They are also instrumentally important,  as in facilitating collective action to provide public  goods.5 And they may be indispensable where soci - eties have to explore largely uncharted transitions to  an aspirational space of expanding human develop - ment while easing planetary pressures.6 Human development, understood as expanding  the four aspects of capabilities, thus becomes both  the end and the means. Agency acquires relevance  because it is difficult, if not impossible, to conceive  of people leading the required transformations if they  are seen only as potential receivers of assistance, as  simply “vehicles of wellbeing,”7 as mere patients  —  rather than as agents able to judge, to commit and to  give priority to goals and values that may go beyond  advancing their wellbeing. Recognizing agency af - firms people not only as the subject of wellbeing- or  welfare- enhancing policies (though these are im - portant) but also as active promoters and catalysts of  social and economic change8 — beyond their own nar - row self-interest.SPOTLIGHT 3.1 How agency differs from wellbeing 114 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 NOTES 1 Sen (1985) suggested that the neglect of agency is shadowed by the  consideration that people are geared exclusively to purse their material  self-interest. 2 Sen (1985) argued that the neglect of options results from assuming that  only actual achievements, or what people end up choosing, counts. See  Sen (1999) for an elaboration on the perspective of seeing development  as freedom. This refers primarily to what Sen called opportunity freedoms,  recognizing that process freedoms, some of which may not be associated  with capabilities, also matter. 3 The original framing around these four categories of capabilities was pro - posed in Sen (1985). The discussion here, including the examples, draws  mainly from the simplified treatment in Sen (2009b). 4 These four aspects of capability often reinforce one another but need  not. For instance, being well nourished is certainly something important  for human life and part of the wellbeing aspect of capabilities. But some - times a commitment to fasting (for religious or political reasons), which  is in the realm of the agency aspect of capabilities, may override the  overwhelming importance that being well-nourished has for most people,  most of the time. And while the state should have an obligation to ensure that everyone has the freedom to be well-nourished, just because the  wellbeing achievement of being well-nourished matters does not imply  that the state should ban fasting. That would be a limitation not only in  people’s freedoms in wellbeing achievements, by precluding the pos - sibility of choosing not to eat, but also in their agency, by excluding the  possibility of making a commitment to fasting (Sen 1985). 5 Shi and others 2020. 6 In standard rational choice theory models, discussed later in the chapter,  temporal-dependent and context-dependent preferences are often seen  as suboptimal deviations from normative choice. But recent evidence  shows how adaptation of preferences is crucial for efficiently representing  information in volatile and uncertain contexts: “Value adaptation confers  distinct benefits to a decision maker in a dynamic world” (Khaw, Glimcher  and Louie 2017, p. 2700). 7 Sen 2009b, p. 288. 8 Indeed, civil society organizations, community initiatives, social move - ments and activists around the world work tirelessly using their agency to  bring about social change. CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 115 SPOTLIGHT 3.2 Agency, ideas and the origins of the  regulatory welfare state Elisabeth Anderson,  New York University Abu Dhabi Can an individual change the course of policy histo - ry? Might such individuals be motivated by shared  ideas from which they do not stand to directly bene - fit? The answer to both questions, I argue in my recent  book, Agents of Reform: Child Labor and the Origins  of the Welfare State,  is a qualified yes. Under certain  conditions, and only with cooperation from others,  individual middle-class reformers exercised deci - sive influence over early legislation to protect work - ers. Acting on culturally embedded ideas about why  industrial labour conditions were problematic, they  exercised creative agency to build political coalitions  and surmount institutional barriers to change. At a  time when labour still lacked the power to demand  protective legislation on its own, these reformers de - serve much of the credit for bringing the regulatory  welfare state into being. Regulatory welfare refers to the web of policies  that protect workers by limiting employers’ arbitrary  power over them. Child labour laws enacted in the  1830s and 1840s were the first of these efforts to in - tervene in the relationship between the new industrial  bourgeoisie and the “free” labour it employed. These  laws formed the bedrock on which vital protections  for adult workers  — including occupational health and  safety regulations as well as the normal working day  —  were eventually built. Still, scholars tend to pay little  attention to this regulatory side of the welfare state.  Agents of Reform aims to correct this through seven  case studies of the political origins of child labour and  factory inspection legislation in 19th century Belgium,  France, Germany and the United States. Throughout much of the 19th century, work - ing-class people were politically marginalized. In  many countries they could not even vote. Moreo - ver, many workers did not regard child labour as a  problem requiring legislative attention; some de - pended on their children’s earnings to survive, and  others were more focused on issues of direct con - cern to adult men. Under these conditions it was middle-class reformers who spearheaded efforts to  enact child labour laws and later to create the factory  inspection systems needed to enforce them. One puzzle is why these reformers bothered to put  time and energy into advocating for policies from  which they themselves did not stand to directly ben - efit. Understanding this requires excavating the ideas  that motivated them  — and these, it turns out, were  surprisingly diverse. Ideologically, child labour and  factory inspection reformers ran the gamut from clas - sical liberalism to religious conservatism to demo - cratic socialism. What united them, however, was  the belief that excessive and premature labour inflict - ed lasting damage on children’s minds, bodies and  souls. Allowing such abuses to continue posed a dire  threat, not only to working-class children’s wellbeing  but also to the nation as a whole. How they interpret - ed this threat varied. For instance, some saw child  workers as potential criminals or revolutionaries who  required the disciplining influence of school, where - as other regarded them as national resources whose  human capital was being squandered. Ideas such as  these informed reformers’ understandings of the  child labour problem and drove them to pursue leg - islation. They were not, at least not in a direct sense,  motivated by simple self-interest. Of course, not all would-be reformers were equal - ly influential. They needed allies. Scrutinizing how  some succeeded while others did not reveals that ef - fective reformers distinguished themselves in two  ways: alliance-building and problem solving. Alliance-building Reformers used a variety of alliance-building  strategies  — including framing, citation, piggyback - ing, compromise and expertise-signalling — in ways  that accorded with the priorities and expectations  of the audiences they needed to convince. Take the  116 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 first of these strategies: frames are ideas that political  actors deploy to convert audiences into allies. To be  effective, frames must resonate with audience mem - bers’ existing ideas or interests; otherwise, they will  fall flat and can even backfire.1 To illustrate this, compare how two reformers  — one  successful, one not — framed the child labour problem  at key coalition-building moments. When Charles  Dupin, a French legislator, argued before the Cham - ber of Peers that child labour rendered “the country  weak in military powers, and poor in all the occupa - tions of peace,”2 he was cleverly framing the issue  as vital to France’s economic and national security  interests. He went on to argue that working children  were likely to grow up to be criminals and deviants  who would destabilize the social order. Such frames  appealed directly to the concerns of political elites  and helped Dupin build a solid coalition around his  proposed child labour bill. In contrast, when Édouard Ducpétiaux, a Belgian  public administrator, framed child labour as a grave  violation of children’s rights, his argument was soon  used against him by chambers of commerce that  were institutionally empowered to weigh in on eco - nomic legislation  — and whose support Ducpétiaux  needed to move forward. The notion that children  had rights that sometimes trumped those of fathers  had not yet been established by law or custom, so the  employers accused Ducpétiaux of trying to upend the  sacred privileges of the pater familias in a misguided  pursuit of “foreign” policy goals. Missteps such as  these contributed to Ducpétiaux’s failure as a child  labour reformer and, by extension, to Belgium’s ina - bility to enact child labour regulation until much later  in the 19th century. Problem solving The second way successful reformers distinguished  themselves was through their willingness to try cre - ative, and at times risky, problem-solving strategies.  When political opponents repeatedly impeded their reform ambitions, they reacted by subverting nor - mal policymaking channels in unconventional ways.  For example, when Theodor Lohmann, a Prussian  commerce ministry official, found his quest for a Re - ich-wide system of factory inspection thwarted at  every turn by his formidable boss, Otto von Bismarck,  he refused to give up. Instead, he went behind the  chancellor’s back, penning anonymous op-ed arti - cles to drum up support, enlisting friends to lobby  their political contacts and, most decisively, secretly  sharing his own factory inspection bill with leaders of  Germany’s second most powerful political party. By  forging an unauthorized and highly risky alliance with  the legislative branch, Lohmann was eventually able  to harness the Reichstag’s power and circumvent Bis - marck’s executive authority. Without Lohmann’s bold  interventions, Germany would not have been able  to mandate factory inspections across the empire, at  least not until after the end of Bismarck’s reign. *   *   * Research on agency and policy change often high - lights policy or institutional entrepreneurs and  stresses that these actors are first and foremost coa - lition-builders.3 My analysis builds on this literature  by specifying various micro-level relational strategies  through which reformers forge alliances and over - come institutional barriers. In doing so, it lends pre - cision to the general claim that their agency matters.  It shows, furthermore, that 19th century labour pro - tections were not simply the outcome of dedicated  reformers’ compassion or morality. Rather, protec - tions were enacted when reformers persuaded law - makers that working children posed hidden threats,  or harboured latent resources, that were relevant to  the interests of elites and the state. At a time when  labour’s political power has eroded and policy pro - gress still requires substantial buy-in from political  elites, these insights remain relevant for social wel - fare reformers today.

CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 117 An agent (someone who acts) makes a rational choice  when acting to do as well as she believes she can to  achieve her preferences.1 There are three independ - ent ingredients in rational choice: stable preferenc - es, rational information processing and beliefs, and  maximization.2 What someone desires (preferences)  is autonomous and does not change. It is what moves  people to pursue their individual self-interest, their  own wellbeing (their utility). They form their be - lief based on information collected to help the agent  make a specific decision. For instance, if someone  prefers not to get wet after leaving the house, how  does she choose whether to grab an umbrella? Ra - tional choice assumes that she makes the decision  based on the combination of the preference (to not  get wet) and the belief about whether it is going to  rain  — for instance, by looking out the window or con - sulting weather forecasts, depending on how impor - tant it is for her to not get wet.3 This concept of agent is very general and is widely  used to describe and explain human behaviour with  economic models,4 framing rational choice as max - imizing individual welfare (typically represented by  a utility function that translates consumption choic - es into welfare).5 Preferences are thus represented  by a utility function that each person seeks to maxi - mize. Powerful extensions account for more general  contexts. When two or more agents are in a situation  where their choices depend on what others do, they  need to form rational expectations (that is, assume  that everyone else behaves according to rational  choice) about what the others will do. This type of  interdependent decisionmaking is studied in game theory, which can be applied to many economic, polit - ical and social settings. More relevant for this Report,  where there is uncertainty  — that is, where different  outcomes are possible, each with a different level of  utility associated with it — the model is reframed as  expected utility theory. The utility (which represents  the agent’s preferences) associated with each possible  outcome is weighed by its probability of occurring and  averaged out in the form of expected utility, which  then represents what the agent seeks to maximize. Under well-specified conditions (for instance,  everyone has access to the same information), eco - nomic agents make choices for what to consume and  produce, exchanging what they are endowed with in  markets, leading to an economic equilibrium that is  reached after all the agents make their best possible  choice in fulfilling their individual motivations.6 The  economic equilibrium is such that no agents can im - prove their utility without harming someone else’s   — designated as Pareto optimality. These results are  often the justification for many policies and insti - tutions. Their scope is justified as correcting viola - tions of the conditions under which this equilibrium  emerges (that is, correcting market failures, ranging  from externalities, when choices have side effects  that are not included in the moment of choice, to sit - uations in which some agents have more information  than others). Policies and institutions often focus  on structuring incentives  — changing prices through  taxes, for instance, to bring the actual conditions  under which people make choices closer to the speci - fied conditions under which the model yields the de - sired Pareto optimum equilibrium.SPOTLIGHT 3.3 The “rational” agent and rational choice theory 118 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 NOTES 1 The description of rational choice in this spotlight draws heavily from  Elster (2021b). A more extensive treatment is presented in Elster (2015). 2 A canonical statement comes from Becker (1976, p. 143): “all human be - haviour can be viewed as involving participants who maximize their utility,  form a stable set of preferences and accumulate an optimal amount of  information and other inputs in a variety of markets.” 3 The example also comes from Elster (2021b). 4 Much of the inspiration for the discussion in this spotlight comes from Hoff  and Stiglitz (2016). 5 A set of axioms that are behaviourally plausible and impose a logical struc - ture to the acts of choice that are allowed to take place is also included  (for example, if someone prefers apples to oranges and oranges to pears,  she also has to prefer apples to pears). For a formal treatment, includ - ing some of the extensions discussed in this paragraph, see Mas-Colell,  Whinston and Green (1995). Key axioms are meant to ensure behaviour where there is consistency of choice, but Sen (1993) argued that seem - ingly inconsistent behaviours do not imply lack of rationality, since they  may reflect the consistent use of decision strategies based on rules. Sen  (2002) argued that there is no way to establish internal consistency of  choice without referring to something external to the act of choice (such  as values or norms). Arkes, Gigerenzer and Hertwig (2016) argue that  coherence in choice cannot be a universal benchmark of rationality. 6 The model formalizes Adam Smith’s intuition that the pursuit of self-interest  in the context of potentially mutually beneficial economic exchange would  make everyone better off, without the need for moral commitments to do - ing something good or under the direction of a supra-individual authority.  It is ironic that Adam Smith is remembered primarily for this insight, when  much of his work was to explore the importance of different motivations  for human behaviour, including the role of moral commitments or social  expectations about what is acceptable behaviour. These observations  draw from Sen (2009b). CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 119 In unsettled times the perpetual question of how  human societies can progress takes on new forms.  This Report diagnoses the multiple sources of inse - curity and distress affecting so many people around  the world at present and in doing so explores some  possible actions policymakers might take. Even set - ting aside immediate pressures such as conflict-relat - ed food shortages and price increases, two long-term  challenges face all of us. One is dealing with the con - sequences of climate change. The other is responding  to the structural economic and social changes being  brought about by disruptive digital technologies. A  long time in the making, both need action now, or  they will increase inequalities and insecurities be - yond the intolerable levels they have already reached. Tackling these challenges will require new ana - lytical tools. This is because the phenomena of en - vironmental damage on the one hand and digital  transformation on the other do not conform to the as - sumptions underlying much conventional economic  analysis and policy recommendations. Both areas are  rife with what economists refer to as externalities or  spillovers, whereby decisions have byproducts in the  form of substantial consequences for others as well  as the decisionmaker. Examples are businesses that  emit pollutants or carbon dioxide, causing environ - mental and societal damage they do not have to pay  for, or in the digital domain the provision of personal  data that reveal information about other individuals   — or conversely that enable platforms to provide a  better service to all their users. Environmental exter - nalities are usually negative, as natural resources are  so often unpriced. Digital externalities can be either  negative or positive. In textbook economics the rule of thumb is that  market prices capture the relevant information for  the best use and allocation of resources; but it is also  textbook economics that this presumption does not  hold when there are pervasive externalities. On the contrary such situations of market failure pose col - lective action problems. Individual incentives lead to  worse outcomes than are possible if there is coordina - tion, led by either governments and public bodies or  community-organized institutions, as in the inspiring  work of Elinor Ostrom. Yet although this is well known, standard econom - ic policy tools continue to assume a simpler world  where it can be reasonably believed that individual  business or personal decisions generally lead to good  economic outcomes, while individual market failures  can be tackled one by one with specific solutions. This  default way of thinking about economic policy, deep - ly embedded in the education and traditions of pol - icymakers for decades, needs to change. The world  has changed beyond recognition from those mental  models of individual choice. To give one example, digital business models using  data and algorithms to deliver services are becom - ing increasingly widespread in many countries. They  hold great promise for individual consumers  — for  example, enhancing access to low-cost financial ser - vices or providing access to markets for small and  medium enterprises. But they need an appropriate  policy framework to govern their use of data and en - sure markets remain open for new entrants. Data are a key resource in the digital economy, but  data’s features are not like a standard economic good.  Data are “nonrival” in that they can be used by many  people simultaneously and are not depleted, and data  can cause harm (a negative externality) by uninten - tionally revealing too much information about people  at the expense of their privacy and offer benefits (pos - itive externalities) when different pieces of data are  joined to provide useful information. Businesses that  acquire a lot of data about users can also turn those  data into a barrier to entry to limit their competition,  as they are in a much better position to both improve  service and earn revenues.SPOTLIGHT 3.4 How can societies make progress in  uncertain times? A question taking on new  forms, calling for new analytical tools Diane Coyle,  Cambridge University. 120 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 Since 2019 the debate about competition policy  has increasingly recognized the challenge posed by  the dominance of a few companies in digital markets,  which are sometimes described as “winner takes all”  or “superstar” markets. However, progress in chang - ing policies to tackle market dominance has been  slow, even in the United Kingdom and the United  States, where the academic and policy debate started  a few years ago. The everyday, practical policy tools  for analysis and remedies do not yet exist. What is more, debates about appropriate govern - ance policies for data more generally are in their  early stages. Should data be “owned” as if a piece of  property when the information that data provide is al - ways relational or contextual? If so, given that using  data creates so much value, who should be assigned  property rights: the collector or the original subject or  source? If not, what framework of access rights and  responsibilities would generate value for society?  How should data users be required to take account of  data bias due to the inequality of society  — and indeed  of people who have no data “voice,” whose activities  and needs are not measured? Another example of an area with many open ques - tions, due to the absence so far of an appropriate  benchmark policy framework, is biodiversity policies.  Partha Dasgupta’s 2020 landmark review of the eco - nomics of biodiversity for Her Majesty’s Treasury in the United Kingdom synthesized the relevant theo - retical framework, but again the spadework needs  to be done to turn conceptual insights into practical  interventions. How can early warning of irreversible  tipping points in ecosystems be recognized? What is  the appropriate geographic scope for measuring and  acting on biodiversity loss? How does it integrate  with agricultural productivity or affect human health? In both arenas, environmental and digital, there  has been considerable excellent academic research at  the frontier of knowledge. But to turn this into action - able insights, the default presumption needs to be  that this is a world of tipping points, multiple possible  outcomes depending on current choices, external - ities and collective action problems. The economic  analysis needs to be integrated with scientific or tech - nical knowledge to deliver practical policy tools. Dif - ferent datasets are required, going beyond standard  economic metrics and dashboards. There are active debates among researchers and  policymakers alike about these kinds of challenges  and much recent progress  — such as the development  of statistical standards for measuring natural capital  and ecosystem services. But shaping an appropriate  mindset for this uncertain, unstable and intercon - nected world remains a challenge. Source: Based on Coyle (2021). CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 121 SPOTLIGHT 3.5 Norms and cooperation in a multipolar  world: Beyond economics Kaushik Basu,  Cornell University As the world battles multiple onslaughts  — from the  fracturing of society, caused by the shifting rules of  economic and social interaction, in turn caused by  the rapid advance in digital technology, to the rise  in climate-related disasters, the Covid-19 pandem - ic that waxes and wanes but refuses to go, and to the  war in Ukraine  — it is time to rethink not just our pol - icies but also the foundations of the social sciences.  Since much of today’s policy challenge relates to eco - nomics, economists have written extensively on these  themes, much of it captured in this Report. There is,  however, a growing contribution from neighbouring  disciplines  — philosophy, politics and sociology  — that  provide insights for economists and urge them to  question some of the assumptions hidden deep in the  woodwork of their own discipline. It is important to  realize that the world that we analyse is partly a con - struction of our discipline.1 As we try to understand  society, which is on the one hand steadily globalizing  and on the other becoming politically polarized with  rising conflict across and within nations, it is critical  to trespass boundaries and draw on these alternate  disciplinary paradigms. Since the Age of Enlightenment, and even before  that, philosophers have been aware of the need for  society to nurture cooperation. Some of this hap - pens naturally from the nudges of the invisible  hand, but we also need agreements and conventions  that coordinate the behaviours of individuals. Such  agreements seem like an impossible task for our  vast, multipolar world. Hope lies in the fact that we  now have a better understanding of how coopera - tion happens and why it often breaks down. This is  because of one instrument that the Enlightenment  philosophers did not have but their progenies do, to  wit, game theory. As a result, there has been a spate  of recent writing that formalizes ideas from the  17th and 18th centuries and helps us think of new  ways to manage society, avert conflict and foster  development.2This new literature is helping us grapple with real-   world problems, from conflict and social inequality to  the role of political leaders. We understand these bet - ter than ever before. How do leaders acquire power?  Why do they have such influence over individuals, at  times hurting the very people who follow them? Sur - prisingly, much of the leader’s ability to stir action  among people arises from nothing but the beliefs  of ordinary individuals. The statements and orders  of the leader create focal points. You believe that,  given a leader’s order or suggestion of order, others  will follow it, and that in turn makes it in your inter - est to follow it as well. When such a confluence of be - liefs occurs, a speech or even an utterance by a leader  can unleash torrents of behaviour among individu - als, propped up by nothing more than beliefs of what  other individuals will do. This kind of analysis can be brought to bear on  practical matters, such as the responsibility people  bear towards their community3 and a leader’s respon - sibility for the behaviour of his or her followers. The  convention is to hold a leader responsible for certain  group behaviour if it can be shown that unleashing  such behaviour was the leader’s intention. Follow - ing the above analysis, it can be argued that a lead - er should also be held responsible for unwarranted  group behaviour if the leader could reasonably be  shown to have been aware that his or her speech or  behaviour would result in the group behaviour, even  if that was not the leader’s intention.4 This altered  view can have large implications for how we interpret  the law, regulate and punish. Because of the large influence of economists, much  of the formal analysis remains confined to individually  rational behaviour. We try to explain all forms of coop - eration by reference to self-interest. This often leads to  exciting mathematical models, but one consequence  of this obsession is we forget that universal self-in - terested behaviour is one of those assumptions in the  woodwork, which we take for granted but is not true. 122 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 Virtually all human beings carry some form of  moral compasses in their heads. They desist from  numerous behaviours not out of self-interest but be - cause their ethics, often deontological principles, do  not permit them. I believe we do not pick other peo - ple’s pockets not because, after doing a cost-benefit  analysis, we conclude that the cost of picking pockets  outweighs the benefit, but because this is an inbuilt  moral code in us. This, in turn, raises questions about the very mean - ing of cooperation. Was the cooperation of Adam  Smith the same as that of philosophers and scholars  of politics?5 Basing our evaluation on a wider disci - plinary foundation also raises vital questions about  value, worth and equality. We can stigmatize individ - uals, banish individuals to the margins and exacer - bate inequities in a variety of ways.6 These inequities  can give rise to fractures and polarizations that have  little to do with economic inequality. Because these are subjects on the fringes of the  social sciences, we know little about the connection  between the nature of norms and moral codes we  adhere to and the level of our economic growth and wellbeing. There is need for more research on this. It  is arguable that to sustain economic development, we  need concurrent moral progress. Michele Moody-Ad - ams argues that what is moral “progress” can be  contested, but we can nevertheless take a stance on  it, and she expressed optimism that moral progress  can be advanced.7 Allen Buchanan and Russell Pow - ell take the agenda forward, showing that this can be  carried over to codes of inclusivity, which are critical - ly important in today’s polarized world.8 As we understand these motivations that go be - yond individual rationality, we can try to cultivate  moral instincts that lead to greater harmony and co - operation in society. The crux of the challenge is to  think of codes of behaviour that individuals as well as  collectivities such as nations adhere to. The aim is to  have agreements, such as minimal constitutions, that  are scientifically constructed. This will not rule out  conflict since the roots of some conflicts go beyond  self-interest.9 Nevertheless, by nurturing certain  codes of behaviour, which are often innately in us an - yway, we can hope to stimulate empathy and further  the collective good for the world.

CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 123 SPOTLIGHT 3.6 Cognitive uncertainty Benjamin Enke,  Harvard University Many of the most important challenges facing human - kind require tradeoffs involving uncertainty and time.  For instance, climate change mitigation measures  are risky in the sense that we do not know precisely  how well they will work. Moreover, climate action in - volves intertemporal tradeoffs because it delivers ben - efits primarily in the future but accrues costs today.  In contexts like these, adequate decisionmaking by  policymakers and individuals requires sophisticated  reasoning about risk and time. Yet, a key insight from  recent research in behavioural economics is that many  economically relevant decisions that involve risk or  intertemporal tradeoffs are cognitively very difficult.  Consider the following two illustrative examples: • Suppose you are offered an investment that pays  $1,000 with a probability of 35 percent and nothing  with a probability of 65 percent. How much would  you be willing to pay for such an asset? Maybe  $220? Are you sure? How about $185? Or $342? • Now suppose you actually won $1,000 and your  banker offers you a safe annual interest rate of  4 percent. How much of your new wealth would you  like to save at this interest rate rather than spend  this year? $600? Are you sure? Not $775 or $452? These examples illustrate a principle that is very gen - eral: in a large range of decisions, people exhibit cogni - tive uncertainty, meaning that they do not know which  decision is actually best for them, given their prefer - ences. Cognitive uncertainty refers to a purely internal   — cognitive  — form of uncertainty, rather than objective  uncertainty about the physical world. Cognitive un - certainty is the result of people’s imperfect ability to  determine the optimal course of action in complex sit - uations. The empirical reality that people often exhibit  cognitive uncertainty contrasts with the approach tra - ditionally taken by behavioural economists, which is  to assume that people may make mistakes but are not  aware of their own cognitive imperfections.1 Why is cognitive uncertainty important? A main  reason is that a growing number of experiments and surveys document that when people are cognitive - ly uncertain, they anchor on a so-called cognitive  default decision.2 A cognitive default decision is the  naïve decision people would make in the absence of  any deliberation: what they would do if they did not  really think about it. In contexts with which people  have experience, this could be a decision they pre - viously made. In contexts with which people do not  have experience, the cognitive default is often to pick  something intermediate or a compromise. Regard - less of what the decision is, much evidence shows  that when people are cognitively uncertain, they an - chor on, or regress to, a cognitive default.3 As a result,  people’s decisions are often poorly calibrated to the  prevailing set of circumstances, in particular under  new environmental conditions. The following sections explore these abstract ideas  in more concrete contexts, by studying how people  think about probabilities (uncertainty) and intertem - poral tradeoffs and then by discussing more spec - ulatively how cognitive uncertainty and cognitive  default decisions may matter for understanding and  addressing current societal challenges. Decisionmaking under uncertainty Almost all economically relevant decisions involve  some risk. As a result, much research in economics  and psychology studies how people learn from in - formation, how they make predictions about future  events (such as the probability that they will lose their  job) and how they choose among different invest - ment strategies (such as whether and how to invest in  the stock market). All these domains require people  to process probabilities. Yet, substantial research has  documented that people have a pronounced tendency  to make decisions that look as if they implicitly treat  all probabilities to some degree alike, which produces  a compression-to-the-centre effect (figure S3.6.1).4 124 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 The left panel of figure S3.6.1 shows the canonical  probability weighting function that depicts how peo - ple typically weight probabilities when they choose  among different monetary gambles. For example,  people overweight a 5 percent chance of winning  $100 but underweight a 95 percent chance of win - ning that amount. Thus, in essence, people treat both  high and low probabilities as more intermediate than  they really are. This is a regularity that economists  have devoted much attention to, as it helps explain  phenomena such as casino gambling, the overpricing  of positively skewed financial assets, the equity pre - mium and why people prefer insurance policies with  low deductibles.5 The middle panel illustrates a common way in  which people’s inferences from new information tend  to be systematically wrong. When people receive in - formation suggesting that a specified event is objec - tively very unlikely to occur, they often overestimate  such small probabilities. On the other hand, when  people receive information suggesting that an event  is very likely to occur, they underestimate such high  probabilities, which again leads to a compression ef - fect towards the centre.Finally, the right panel shows a typical pattern re - garding people’s expectations of how much the stock  market will go up, as a function of objective probabil - ities. Again, people’s probability estimates are typi - cally heavily compressed towards the centre, which  means that people are overly optimistic as far as very  unlikely scenarios are unconcerned but overly pessi - mistic when it comes to very likely scenarios. The similarity of compression effects in these three  probability domains is striking. Yet, until recently,  economists and psychologists often viewed them as  separate phenomena, rather than as being driven by  a common cognitive mechanism.6 One way of jointly accounting for these patterns  across different domains is the simple insight that  people find it cognitively difficult to think about prob - abilities and, therefore, anchor on an intermediate  cognitive default decision.7 The main idea is that  people mentally start out from an intermediate de - cision, something that is far from the extremes and  feels moderate. Upon deliberation, they then insuffi - ciently adjust in the direction of the rational decision  (the decision that would be expected under a stand - ard rational choice model). Crucially, the idea is that Figure S3.6.1 People have a pronounced tendency to make decisions that look as if they implicitly treat all  probabilities to some degree alike Choice under riskGambling money Belief updatingProcessing information S&P 500 performance expectationsPredicting future events Payoﬀ probabilityImplied probability weight 0.25.5.751 0 .25 .5 .75 1 Risk-neutral expected utility  benchmark Decisions of experimental  participantsBayesian posteriorStated posterior 0.25.5.751 0 .25 .5 .75 1 Rational (Bayesian) beliefs Beliefs of experimental  participantsTrue probabilityStated probability 0.25.5.751 0 .25 .5 .75 1 Historical probability Expectations of survey  participants Source: Enke and Graeber 2019. CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 125 the magnitude of the adjustment towards the ration - al decision decreases in cognitive uncertainty. Thus,  people who are extremely cognitively uncertain will  decide based purely on the cognitive default deci - sion, while people who do not exhibit any cognitive  uncertainty will make a rational decision. According  to this hypothesis, cognitively uncertain decisions are  more compressed towards the centre. Testing of this hypothesis through a series of ex - periments and surveys that measured people’s cog - nitive uncertainty revealed that in all three decision  domains in figure S3.6.1, the gist of the results was  the same: higher cognitive uncertainty is strongly  associated with greater compression of decisions  towards the centre (figure S3.6.2).8 Intuitively, this  makes sense: when people do not know how to value  a risky asset, or if they do not know how to form  probabilistic estimates about variables such as stock  market returns, they anchor on an intermediate de - cision and then only partially adjust away from it. As  a result, cognitively uncertain people overestimate  the probability of unlikely events and overweight  low probabilities when they translate them into risky decisions. Likewise, cognitively uncertain people  underestimate the probability of likely events and  underweight low probabilities when they translate  them into risky decisions. However, these patterns  do not arise because people have acquired do - main-specific errors or even preferences  — instead,  they reflect a general heuristic according to which  people find it difficult to think about probabilities  and, therefore, treat different probabilities to some  degree alike. Intertemporal decisions Consider now an entirely different set of decisions,  in which people trade off money (or other goods) at  different points in time. For example, an experiment  participant may be asked whether she would prefer to  receive $90 today or $100 in a year from now. A large  body of empirical work has documented that people’s  intertemporal decisions are often characterized by a  type of compression effect that is very similar to the  one seen in the case of probabilities.9 Figure S3.6.2 Higher cognitive uncertainty is strongly associated with greater compression of decisions  towards the centre Choice under risk Belief formation Implied probability weight 0255075100 0 20 40 60 80 100 ±1 standard error of median Risk-neutral predictionHigh cognitive uncertainty Low cognitive uncertaintyPayoﬀ probability Bayesian posteriorPosterior belief 0255075100 0 20 40 60 80 100 Note: The left panel illustrates the probability weighting function in choices between monetary lotteries, and the right panel shows reported beliefs  in laboratory belief formation experiments. Source: Enke and Graeber 2019. 126 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 S3.6.3  illustrates this by showing how much peo - ple typically value a payment of $100 to be received  at different points in time. For example, the left panel  shows that, on average, people value $100 in nine  months roughly as much as $60 today and that they  value $100 in four years as much as $40 today. The  main takeaway is that people’s decisions seem to  treat different time delays to some degree alike. For  example, people seem to behave as if it makes almost  no difference to them whether they receive $100 in  two years or in three. Overall, this leads to a compres - sion effect, according to which people’s valuation of  a delayed payment of $100 is again compressed to - wards an intermediate value of roughly $50. Popular models such as the standard discounted  expected utility model, or models of present bias,10  cannot explain these puzzling patterns. For example,  the extreme compression effect towards the centre  also occurs when people make decisions that involve  tradeoffs between two future dates (right panel of fig - ure S3.6.3), such that present bias cannot play a role. One hypothesis is that these patterns do not (only)  reflect present bias or other nonstandard preferences but that they are again driven by complexity and re - sulting cognitive uncertainty.11 The intuition is that  when people are cognitively uncertain about exactly  how much a payment of $100 in three years is worth  to them today, they again anchor on an intermediate  cognitive default decision and then adjust from there   — but insufficiently so. According to this hypothesis,  relative to the benchmark of a rational decisionmak - er, people with cognitive uncertainty will look less pa - tient over short horizons (because the intermediate  cognitive default “drags down” their patience), yet  they will appear more patient over long horizons. Experiments measuring people’s cognitive un - certainty when making these types of intertemporal  decisions show that cognitive uncertainty is strongly  predictive of the degree to which people’s intertem - poral decisions seem to treat all time delays alike  (figure S3.6.4).12 As a result, cognitively uncertain  people exhibit excessively high impatience over short  horizons, such as in tradeoffs between today and in  three months. However, in contrast to conventional  preferences-based accounts of intertemporal choice,  such impatience does not largely reflect genuinely  Figure S3.6.3 People’s decisions about value seem to treat different time delays to some degree alike Intertemporal choice: Delay starting today Intertemporal choice: Delay starting in the future Time delay (years)Normalized indiﬀerence point 0255075100 0 1 4 6 7 Discounted utility benchmark Experimental subjects' discount function2 3 5 Time delay (years)Normalized indiﬀerence point 0255075100 0 1 4 6 7 2 3 5 Note: The left panel shows people’s typical behaviour in tradeoffs between the present and the future, and the right panel shows people’s typical  behaviour in tradeoffs between two different future points in time.

Recap: Commonalities across decision domains The common theme that emerges from the preced - ing discussion is that people’s inability to think  through tricky decision problems is a unifying el - ement that ties together various behaviours. How  people update their beliefs in light of new informa - tion, how they choose between different risky assets  and how they trade off different time-dated rewards  are, in principle, three different domains of econom - ic decisionmaking. Indeed, economists have devised  sophisticated models for each of these domains. Yet,  while there is much benefit in focusing on each deci - sion domain in isolation, doing so also sometimes ob - scures important commonalities across domains. In  particular, we have seen that people are often unsure  what the best decision is, that cognitive uncertainty  is strongly linked to taking “intermediate” decisions that make it seem as if people treat different proba - bilities and time delays alike and that this mechanism  generates many of the famous empirical regularities  that behavioural economists and psychologists have  accumulated over the years. According to the logic of  cognitive uncertainty, these regularities are all inti - mately linked. Potential implications for societal challenges The main takeaway from the studies summarized  above is that when people are cognitively uncertain   — that is, when they find a decision problem difficult  to think through  — they anchor on a cognitive default  and then insufficiently adjust in the direction of the  rational decision. As a result, decisions look as if peo - ple underreact to changes in the prevailing circum - stances such as the probabilities of different events. In experiments the default decision is consistently  intermediate in nature, which could reflect a naïve di - versification or compromise logic. Yet, these choice  experiments all involve contexts with which most  people have limited or no experience. This raises the  question what constitutes people’s cognitive default  decision in situations with which they do have expe - rience, as is usually the case in reality. A plausible conjecture is that when people are cog - nitively uncertain “in the wild,” they intuitively an - chor on their typical past decision and then adjust  from there. For instance, people who always save  $100 of their salary might continue to do so even  when the interest rate suddenly changes  — purely be - cause they find the decision very difficult to think  through and they therefore anchor on their past deci - sion.13 Again, such a pattern of behaviour would pro - duce an underreaction to changes in environmental  conditions. This perspective offers a new lens through which  behaviour in the general public regarding societal  challenges can be understood. For example, thinking  through the consequences of climate change for one’s  own life is cognitively extremely challenging. Even  if we knew for certain that temperatures will rise by  3°C over the next 30 years, it is very hard (even for  experts) to think through how this would affect the  structure of our economies and lifestyles. In other  words it is most likely true that people exhibit very Figure S3.6.4 Cognitive uncertainty is strongly predictive  of the degree to which people’s intertemporal decisions  seem to treat all time delays alike Experimental results: Intertemporal choice Time delay (months)Normalized indiﬀerence point ±1 standard error of median High cognitive uncertaintyLow cognitive uncertainty0255075100 0 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 Note: The dots show how much participants value a cash payment or food  voucher of $100 at different points in time.

Which skills will be valued 30 years  from now? How should I optimally behave in light of  these changes? How and where should I optimally  choose to live given these developments? Even in the absence of any objective uncertainty  about the physical word, these questions are cogni - tively extremely difficult to think through. This cog - nitive difficulty may induce people to anchor on the  cognitive default of making the same decisions as in  the past, which then mechanically produces an un - derreaction to changes in economic and climatic con - ditions. For example, the relatively low investment  into climate change adaptation in the past may serve  as a cognitive anchor for determining today’s invest - ments. If true, this would suggest that the apparent  underreaction in the population to new economic or climatic conditions partly reflects the cognitive dif - ficulty of thinking through complex topics, rather  than necessarily selfish or short-sighted preferences.  This account is potentially valuable because it adds  a new perspective and policy prescription. Rather  than lament about people’s preferences or even try to  change them, policymakers may be more successful at  inducing people to adjust their behaviours by helping  them imagine and think through a future with climate  change: what people’s lives will look like, which types  of jobs they will be competing for, how they will com - mute to work and what their children will learn. Only  when people understand the implications of abstract  policy discussions for which decisions they need to  make to prepare themselves for the future  — once peo - ple have reduced their cognitive uncertainty  — may  they be able to make the decisions that policymakers  and international organizations are hoping for.

CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 129 SPOTLIGHT 3.7 Human agency can help restore biodiversity:  The case of forest transitions Erle C. Ellis,  University of Maryland, Baltimore County Biodiversity losses are increasingly recognized as a  global crisis demanding transformative changes in  human societies to halt further losses and to better  conserve and restore biodiversity.1 Forest habitats  generally sustain more species than other terrestrial  biomes, and moist tropical forests are among the most  biodiverse ecosystems on Earth.2 As a result, the con - version, degradation and fragmentation of forests and  other biodiverse wild habitats by agriculture and other  intensive land uses are currently the leading cause of  biodiversity losses across the terrestrial biosphere.3 For more than a century, human demands for food,  fibre and other land use products have soared to sus - tain the growth of increasingly well-off populations  and their choice of richer diets, including animal  products and other land-demanding commodities.4  To meet these demands, land use for crops and pas - tures have replaced forests and other habitats across  more than 35 percent of Earth’s ice-free land area.5  Yet despite this alarming long-term trend, the glob - al area of agricultural land has not increased signif - icantly since the 1990s, even while the amount of  food produced per capita has risen faster than popu - lation for more than half a century.6 Biodiversity losses remain a serious concern as the  global area used for intensive crops continues to grow,  both within existing agricultural areas and through  deforestation, especially in less developed tropical  regions, where biodiversity losses from land conver - sion are greatest.7 Nevertheless, tropical deforesta - tion appears to be slowing, and forests and other wild  habitats are regenerating in the more developed tem - perate regions of the world where less suitable agri - cultural land is being abandoned.8 Though it remains  unlikely that global forest area in 2030 could increase  by 3 percent relative to 2015 to meet target 1.1 of the  United Nations Strategic Plan for Forests, annual net  loss of forests has been nearly halved since the 1990s,  to about 0.1 percent a year, as a result of declining de - forestation rates and increasing forest regeneration rates.9 Clearly, some forest trends are going in the  right direction, especially in the more developed re - gions of the world. The large-scale regeneration of forests following the  abandonment of agricultural land was first identified  as a general pattern of forest recovery in developed re - gions of Europe starting in the late 1800s.10 In recent  decades these so-called forest transitions, defined  as sustained regional shifts from net deforestation to  net reforestation, are increasingly being observed in  contemporary temperate and tropical regions around  the world.11 The early forest transitions of Europe, the  United States and elsewhere were first explained by  an economic development pathway in which urban - ization and industrialization drove labour scarcity in  agriculture, leading to agricultural intensification to in - crease total production using the most suitable lands,  enabling profits to be maximized and leading to the  abandonment of less productive agricultural lands,  where forests then regenerated spontaneously.12 More recently, “economic” forest transitions have  also been explained, to some degree, through “land  use displacement pathways,” in which forests recover  in one region while potentially being lost in another,  when agricultural demands are outsourced through  globalized supply chains, often to developing regions  of the tropics.13 In land use displacement pathways  the biodiversity benefits of forest regeneration may  be reversed many times over, unless the receiving ag - ricultural region has very high yields (and therefore  lower net land area requirements), owing to the high - er biodiversity of most tropical regions and the poten - tial for land use conversions through deforestation.14  Additional pathways towards forest transitions have  emerged in recent decades, including state and non - governmental organization–supported tree planting  programmes and through land use policies and reg - ulatory pathways supporting forest conservation and  restoration to meet international targets for carbon  and biodiversity.15 130 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 Global supply chain transparency initiatives and  voluntary certification of sustainable production are  helping reduce losses of tropical forests produced  through land use displacement.16 But there is still a  long way to go.17 Even though forest transitions are  increasingly evident around the world, including  in many developing tropical regions,18 at the global  scale, biodiversity losses remain inevitable whenever  land use is simply exported to other regions,19 unless  their productivity is substantially higher or their bio - diversity is substantially lower. The ultimate prospects for a global forest transi - tion to halt losses of biodiversity will depend on the degree to which commodity demands can be met by  increasingly intensive land use practices that shrink  land demand overall  — the classic “economic” path - way of urban and industrial development — combined  with efforts to prioritize the conservation and resto - ration of the most biodiverse regions on Earth.20 The  pace of this development, including urbanization  and agricultural intensification, and the governance  of global commodity supply chains21 will ultimately  determine not only the fate of Earth’s remaining bio - diversity but also the future of human opportunities  with respect to food, housing, employment, recrea - tion and other essential conditions.

CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 131  Shaping   our future in a  transforming  worldPART II 134 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022PART II Shaping our future in a transforming world Beyond causing frustration and unsettling minds  (chapter 2), the uncertainties described in chapter  1 can also undermine the ability to act collectively.  Uncertainty has different manifestations. At the in - dividual level it can be seen in the form of human  insecurity. This chapter shows that perceptions of in - security are associated with mistrust and with politi - cal polarization—people who feel insecure trust others  less and are more prone to politically extreme posi - tions. Meanwhile, changes to our information systems are reshaping how people form beliefs and how they  interact with one another. The social changes brought  on by rapidly evolving digital communications tech - nology place additional pressures on human interac - tion. Together, these two shifts are jeopardizing public  deliberation and social choice (chapter 4). But uncer - tainty can also open new possibilities for action, since  it can reframe what is perceived as possible and need - ed: this is explored in chapter 5, on the way to chapter  6, which provides suggestions on the way forward. PART II — SHAPING OUR FUTURE IN A TRANSFORMING WORLD 135  PART II — SHAPING OUR FUTURE IN A TRANSFORMING WORLDWhat’s standing  in the way of our  acting together?CHAPTER 4 138 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022The paradox of our time is paralysis: we know what  the problems are, we have more tools than ever to  address them, but we are failing to act. Why? What is getting in the way? This chapter points to polarization and how  uncertainty and insecurity can exacerbate it. Trust is  down; political extremism is up. Hyperinformation is  sowing division. Spaces for public deliberation are  shrinking right when they are needed most.CHAPTER 4 What’s standing in the way of our acting together? The unprecedented multilayered uncertainties   — coming from the Anthropocene context, social  and technological transformations and political  polarization  — test our social, economic and political  institutions, as well as the patterns of behaviour that  shape and are shaped by those institutions. The link  between the two, as chapter 3 discusses, is the result  of procedures of social choice, reflected in how socie - ties craft collective responses. Why has it proven so difficult to craft these collec - tive responses, which demand changes in both behav - iour and institutions, despite clear evidence of harm  to come for people, societies and the planet? Chapter  3 argues that current configurations of behaviour and  institutions are not responding effectively to a novel  context of uncertainty. This mismatch increases the  importance of processes of public deliberation and  social choice in shaping the behavioural and insti - tutional changes needed in an uncertain world. Pro - cesses of social choice that harness people’s diverse  goals, motivations, beliefs and emotions can be a  powerful driver of social change. However, in many countries today, processes of  public deliberation and social choice are coming  under strain amid intensifying political polarization  and divisiveness.1 Political polarization can be under - stood as “the extent to which citizens become ideo - logically entrenched in their own values and political  beliefs, thereby increasing the divide with citizens  who hold different values and political beliefs.”2 Po- larization tends to make people close in on their in- groups and be reluctant to interact, exchange and  communicate with out-groups. Affective polarization   — the tendency to view out-group members negative - ly and in-group members positively3 — antagonizes  people across partisan lines.4 This animosity is added  to the other forms of issue-based and ideological po - larization between groups that have long been stud - ied in sociology and political science.5 This chapter explores how polarization can inten - sify because of two intertwined developments. First,  the unsettling of people’s lives and experiences of  human insecurity. Second, the massive economic,  social and political shift driven by a rapidly chang - ing (digital) information context. It discusses how  political polarization might diminish the space for  imaginative, effective and just actions needed today,  before suggesting how we might break the hold of uncertainty on collective responses, taking us from a  confused reacting mode to a purposeful harnessing  of uncertainty towards a hopeful future. Uncertain times, divided societies The layers of uncertainty discussed in chapter 1 are  interacting to produce new shocks and dislocations.  But uncertainty is not only about shocks and disloca - tions; it is also about growing gaps in our collective  ability to “make sense” of the world when deciding  our actions. Progress in recent decades has been re - markable in many aspects of human development,  particularly in wellbeing achievements, despite  marked (and in some cases increasing) inequalities  (see chapter 1).6 But despite widespread progress in  wellbeing achievements, around half the population  does not see progress in their living standards relative  to those of their parents. About 40  percent of those  who have more education than their parents do not  perceive intergenerational progress, vividly showing  how expectations of higher future living standards  are being dashed.7 Uncertainty and human insecurity  parallel increases in polarization When uncertainty translates into unsettled lives and  human insecurity, it can increase polarization, im - pacting processes of social choice. Building on the  analysis in chapter 3, the following discussion high - lights the importance of considering beliefs, motiva - tions and emotions as factors accounting for why it  seems hard for people to act individually and collec - tively in the face of uncertainty. Together, these fac - tors shape the issues people find important, people’s  attitudes and behaviours towards others, and the ac - tions people support or undertake themselves.8 “ When uncertainty translates into  unsettled lives and human insecurity,  it can increase polarization, impacting  the processes of social choice What is the connection between uncertain times  and a range of beliefs that matter for public deliber - ation? Here we use the World Values Survey, whose  CHAPTER 4 — WHAT’S STANDING IN THE WAY OF OUR ACTING TOGETHER? 139 representative sample covers around 80  percent of  the global population, to check how people’s percep - tions of insecurity appear connected with beliefs that  worsen polarization. Perceived human insecurity is  a partial measure of individual uncertainty that mir - rors how people’s fundamental freedoms (from want,  fear and indignity) are being affected today (box 4.1).  We first show how perceived human insecurity is  connected with people’s feelings of agency and con - trol over their lives and with their trust in others. The  evidence here suggests that greater human insecuri - ty is linked to lower individual agency and trust. We  then explore associations between perceived human  insecurity and people’s political preferences, show - ing that greater human insecurity is linked to people  holding extreme political preferences. The combina - tion of high insecurity, lower interpersonal trust and  high polarization is more prevalent in low Human  Development Index (HDI) countries and among  lower-  income people. Greater human insecurity is linked with  lower individual agency and trust Human insecurity can directly restrict human agen - cy. High human insecurity reduces people’s ability  to make autonomous decisions because of lack of  resources, because of fear or because of social dis - crimination. These effects often extend to the overall  perception of agency to make choices over their own  lives: people with greater human insecurity tend to  perceive lower agency (figure 4.1).9 Trust in one another influences prospects for co - operation in a group. People tend to trust people clos - er to them (such as family) more than people whom  they do not know or who have a different social back - ground (as with different nationalities or religions).  Lower trust in socially “distant” people influences  social discrimination,10 among other socioeconomic  outcomes.11 This pattern tends to be stronger across  individuals with low incomes and with greater human  insecurity (figure 4.2).12 In other words people with  high incomes and high human security have greater  trust in people from more socially distant groups. Addressing the common challenges that we con - front today requires cooperation in contexts beyond  those where intragroup cooperation tends to be  high  — in particular, addressing planetary challenges implies collaboration not only between governments  but also across other institutions (chapter 6). Inter - personal trust (the most general trust, in essential - ly any human being) has been declining over time.  Globally, fewer than 30 percent of people think that  “most people can be trusted,” the lowest recorded  value. There is a close association between interper - sonal trust and human security.13 Greater human insecurity is linked  to political extremism Greater human insecurity is also linked to political  extremism, understood as attitudes and behaviours  representing polar views or the single-minded pursuit  of one goal over others.14 We capture the first aspect  using preferences along the left-right political spec - trum. People experiencing greater human insecu - rity tend to have a stronger preference for the polar  extremes of the political spectrum: the proportion of Box 4.1 The Index of Perceived Human Insecurity To track human insecurity, we use the Index of Perceived  Human Insecurity. It is based on wave 6 (2010–2014)  and wave 7 (2015–2022) of the World Values Survey1  and reflects mainly a pre-Covid-19 context. The index  is computed for 77 countries and territories, covering  around 80 percent of the global population. It combines  17 variables covering violent conflict and socioeconomic,  personal and community-level insecurity. These insecuri - ties reflect challenges to freedom from want, freedom  from fear and freedom from indignity. • For insecurity from violent conflict, the index uses  variables reflecting worries about a war involving the  country of residence, a civil war or a terrorist attack. • For socioeconomic insecurity the index uses variables  representing explicit worries (losing a job, not being  able to give children education) and actual depriva - tions in health, food and economic security. • For insecurity at the personal and community levels,  the index uses variables of exposure to crime, change  in habits because of security concerns, overall safety  perception of the neighbourhood and assessment of  specific risks (including robbery, alcohol and drugs on  the streets, abuse by law enforcement and racism).

Here, we consider ev - idence on some of the factors known to contribute to  polarization: • Behavioural drivers affected by a context of un - certainty can intensify people’s identification with  their own social groups. Adding to this is that peo - ple in one group are also generally prone to forming  incorrect beliefs about people in other groups, with  implications for prospects of cooperation across  groups. • Institutional drivers, particularly those associated  with inequalities and disruptive changes in our in - formation systems. The empirical evidence presented above suggests  that individual uncertainty (proxied by perceived  human insecurity) is associated with a particular set of beliefs: diminished agency, lack of trust in others  and more extreme political beliefs. The next section  expands this discussion to additional behavioural fac - tors that can contribute to polarization, as well as in - stitutional conditions that drive polarization. Behavioural factors There is some evidence of a causal link between mul - tiple manifestations of uncertainty and political po - larization.18 It comes from different disciplines, with  several noting the need for humans to reduce or “re - solve” uncertainty.19 For instance, the “need for clo - sure” or the “desire for a definite answer on some  topic, any answer as opposed to confusion and am - biguity…”20 appears as a key motivation for human  behaviour.Figure 4.3 Greater insecurity is linked to political extremism Share of population (%) Extreme  leftExtreme  right Leaning leftMiddle ground Leaning right30 20 10 0Human insecurity level Low Medium or high Very high Political self-identiﬁcation Source: Human Development Report Office based on World Values Survey, waves 6 and 7. See Haerpfer and others (2022). 142 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 According to the significance quest theory, people  need social worth and significance.21 This need is ac - tivated by deprivation (rooted in failure, humiliation  or rejection) or incentivization (the opportunity to  boost one’s significance), which are linked to mani - festations of human insecurity and uncertainty in  general. When activated, the quest for significance  enhances ideological narratives that support the  values of people’s group or culture that give mean - ing to their lives. As a result, people can be attract - ed to affiliating with social identities that become  an “antidote” to uncertainty, social identities that  are in part affirmed as being different — at the limit,  completely opposite  — from others, which can lead to  polarization.22 Another form of adjustment could be through  group identification, as in the uncertainty identity  theory: feelings of uncertainty (particularly related  to self) motivate people to identify with, switch to or  reform social groups in order to cope with those feel - ings.23 Self-uncertainty strengthens group identifica - tion, favouring groups with greater distinctiveness and clear leadership. Through this process self-un - certainty facilitates radicalization (self-identification  with more extreme groups and well-delimited iden - tities), potentially culminating in the support of more  authoritarian leaders.24 More generally, experimental  analysis of brain activity through magnetic resonance  imaging indicates that people with greater intoler - ance of uncertainty are more likely to show more  neural synchrony with politically like-minded peers  and less with opponents, fuelling the formation of po - larized beliefs.25 These mechanisms can be exploited by political  entities and leaders, targeting individuals struggling  with high personal uncertainty through compelling  narratives that are embraced even if they include the  justification of extreme behaviours, such as politi - cal violence.26 Attractive extreme political ideologies  often connect to people’s distress, cognitive simplici - ty (such as a black-and-white perception of the social  world), overconfidence in judgment and intolerance  towards alternative views because of perceived moral  superiority.27 Elites are often politically incentivized Figure 4.4 Insecurity is associated with polarization on preferences over government versus individual responsibility 50 40 30 20 10 0Share of population (%) Extreme  individual reponsibilityExtreme  government reponsibility Leaning individualMiddle ground Leaning governmentHuman insecurity level Low Medium or high Very high Preference for individual versus government responsibility Source: Human Development Report Office based on World Values Survey, waves 6 and 7.

CHAPTER 4 — WHAT’S STANDING IN THE WAY OF OUR ACTING TOGETHER? 143 to fuel polarization, with direct negative campaigns,  uncivil discourse and vitriol against political oppo - nents28 or to leverage divisions over contentious so - cial issues, such as immigration and race in some  settings.29 Elite polarization has been found to result  in greater affective polarization in the electorate  —  when elite positions are polarized, people express  more negative sentiment towards opposing par - ties30 and become more tolerant of undemocratic  behaviour.31 “ The confluence of heightened uncertainty with  high inequality often seems to favour support  for authoritarian leaders, who are less likely to  foster intragroup and intergroup cooperation The style of leadership supported in uncertain  times may also favour support for authoritarian lead - ers. Anthropology and social psychology have iden - tified two routes through which leaders emerge.32  One is by acquiring prestige, respect and admiration  and being recognized as possessing superior skills,  achievements or knowledge. The other is by becom - ing dominant, assertive, controlling, decisive and  confident, often coercing or inducing fear. In contexts  of economic uncertainty dominant leaders often ap - pear to have greater appeal than prestige leaders.33  And higher economic inequality also attracts and  often favours support for dominance-oriented lead - ers, with inequality also providing incentives for lead - ers to pursue their own self-interest over the interests  of the groups they lead.34 The confluence of height - ened uncertainty with high inequality thus often  seems to favour support for authoritarian leaders,  who are less likely to foster intragroup and intergroup  cooperation. Polarization has to do with a group forming nega - tive beliefs about other out-groups, and people are  generally prone to forming such beliefs in an incor - rect way. A substantial body of evidence shows that  people’s perceptions about others are generally bi - ased.35 People can misjudge what other individuals  in society think, feel and do.36 Not only is mispercep - tion of others widespread, it also tends to be asym - metric: far more people hold beliefs about others that  fall on one side of the truth over the other.37 In par - ticular, people harbour greater misperceptions when  considering those outside their own social groups than those closer to them. Inaccurate perceptions  about out-groups are widespread, with evidence to  this effect over localized points of disagreement in 26  countries.38 Indeed, people’s perception that others hold more  extreme positions than they actually do itself contrib - utes to polarization. People’s perception that those  from opposing parties hold extreme positions has  been found to be more strongly associated with an - imus towards out-party members than with actual  differences in policy preferences.39 People who iden - tify with a specific group underestimate the extent  to which they agree with the views of other groups’  opponents.40 People also tend to misperceive how  others view them. These perceptions are uniquely  associated with hostility, aggression and in some set - tings a willingness to violate democratic norms.41 What might explain people’s tendencies to routine - ly misperceive others? One candidate is stereotyping,  where people tend to adopt overgeneralized mental  models of out-group members. Another is motivated  reasoning: people are biased towards interpreting in - formation in ways that affirm their beliefs. So, affec - tive factors could be contributing to misperception  (rather than the other way around  — misperceptions  causing people to have negative attitudes towards  others).42 Institutional factors The rise in polarization today comes alongside  progress in other dimensions of human wellbeing   — greater economic prosperity, uptake of new tech - nologies, and improvements in health, education and  gender equality  — and despite the formal strengthen - ing of socioeconomic institutions (box 4.2). Increas - ing polarization amid greater progress signals that  what is often called “development” may not always  deliver for people as expected. In-group–out-group polarization can be framed  in the context of the potential mismatch discussed  in chapter 3. A rapid transformation with new lay - ers of uncertainty can shake norms and values that  are ill matched to current realities. This triggers ad - vocates of new responses, risking polarization be - tween advocates for change and those rejecting or  alienated by change.43 Intragroup cohesiveness can  increase when people are confronted with threats  but often at the expense of intergroup cooperation.  144 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 For instance, after violent conflict, trust and cooper - ation increase within groups but not between them.44  War also seems to increase religiosity, another form of affiliating with a social group based on shared be - liefs.45 People seek to reduce ambivalence in their per - ception of others by creating clear “us” and “them” Box 4.2 Progress with polarization in the global Positive Peace Index The Positive Peace Index measures the positive peace of 163 countries, covering 99.6 percent of the world popula - tion. Positive peace is defined as the attitudes, institutions and structures that create and sustain peaceful societies.  It is based on more than 45,700 data series, indices and attitudinal survey variables in conjunction with current  thinking about the drivers of violent conflict, resilience and peacefulness. The index covers eight pillars, using three  indicators for each. The pillars are: • Well-functioning government. • Equitable distribution of resources. • Free flow of information. • Good relations with neighbours. • High human capital. • Acceptance of the rights of others. • Low corruption. • Sound business environment. The 24 indicators fall into three domains: • Attitudes, which measure social views, tensions  or perceptions. • Institutions, which are associated with the func - tioning of the formal and informal organizations  that manage and influence the socioeconomic  system. • Structures, which are embedded in the frame - work of society, such as poverty and equality, or  are the result of aggregate activity, such as GDP. The six indicators in the attitudes domain are  factionalized elites, group grievance, quality of in - formation, exclusion by socioeconomic condition,  hostility to foreigners and freedom of the press.  These indicators were used as proxies for social  attitudes — that is, the way individuals and groups  perceive and interact within their society. • Deteriorations in attitudes are changes in social perceptions and patterns of interactions among individuals and  groups that lead to more social disharmony, more violence or fear thereof, deeper political instability or more  disruptive economic inefficiencies. • Improvements in attitudes are changes in social perceptions and patterns of interaction among individuals and  groups that lead to enhanced social cohesion, less violence, more political cooperation, greater institutional trans - parency and economic efficiencies. Using this classification framework, the data suggest a steep divergence in development patterns over the past 10  years (box figure 1). The global average of the structures domain suggests uninterrupted progress, as gauges of ag - gregate economic performance, scientific and technological development, and business indicators have continually  improved since 2009. By contrast, the global averages of the attitudes domain have deteriorated markedly — a proxy  for polarization. The institutions domain has also deteriorated, though modestly. This is the paradox of economic and business progress with increasing social polarization. Despite improvements  in aggregate economic performance, technological advancement and business opportunities, societies appear to  have become less harmonious, and political preferences appear to have become more factionalized and intolerant.

CHAPTER 4 — WHAT’S STANDING IN THE WAY OF OUR ACTING TOGETHER? 145 boundaries.46 The tightening47 of social norms and  their heightened enforcement or sanctioning are  also a collective response to cope with threats and  uncertainty48 — perhaps an evolved cultural adaption  to deal collectively with uncertainty.49 But mismatch - es can occur when some societies overtighten norms  in the face of perceived tangible threats and loosen  them in the face of real threats.50 Economic hardship and income inequality might  parallel trends in polarization.51 Beliefs and behav - iours prioritizing in-group affiliation can emerge as  coping mechanisms in times of economic volatility  and rising inequality, possibly leading to group po - larization.52 This acquires different manifestations  in different geographic contexts, but large num - bers of people around the world are already feeling  the dislocations associated with the implications of  trade, technology or both. In nearly all high-income  and upper middle-income countries, wage income  to workers is shrinking as a share of GDP.53 Pros - pects will improve for some people  —  those with the  enhanced capabilities to seize on the opportunities  of the 21st century.54 But other groups will feel less  secure  — those seeing their livelihoods or social status  threatened. In times of hardship or in places where  dislocations cause economic hardship, polarization  intensifies, and support can increase for leaders who  reject pluralism, including those hostile to foreigners  and migrants.55 Inequalities, and perceptions of inequality,56 may  undermine the basic promise of fundamental po - litical equality.57 It is argued that we are witness - ing the secession from political life58 of those at the  very top, isolated and disconnected through their  privilege, and those at the very bottom, disaffect - ed and disenfranchised in their agency and voice.  These inequalities  — especially income and wealth  inequality  — have an impact on political engagement,59  which often translates into low political participa - tion among the most disadvantaged.60 Institutions  have sometimes struggled to safeguard the integrity  of the rituals of choice whereby societies can collec - tively and iteratively design their fate and determine  the winning and losing political positions without un - dermining formal systems and without disagreement  turning into disrespect of others and of institutions.61  In recent decades inequalities have been accom - panied by rising nationalism and identity-based politics in many countries. There is substantial vari - ation across countries in how class-based inequalities  interact with other social divides, leading to diverse  patterns in political cleavages; how political institu - tions manage these cleavages also influences dynam - ics between groups (spotlight 4.1). “ Inequalities, and perceptions of inequality,  may undermine the basic promise of  fundamental political equality Widening inequalities and worsening prospects  for many workers around the world are connected to  the global rise of market power of some firms: as the  winner-takes-all structure of new technologies paired  with challenged antitrust policies allows some com - panies to thrive with high profits, while lower shares  of income accrue to workers.62 The rise in market  power can lead to monopolistic competition, raising  company profits while keeping worker wages low.63  Firms that were able to innovate in new information  platforms are now giants of technology. These “su - perstar” firms, with a high capacity to innovate and  very high profits, have seen rising market power.  Their markups (the difference between sales prices  and production costs) are high, contributing to the  decline in the labour’s share of income.64 Hyper-information is powering social  division and polarization As chapter 3 argues, we may be confronting a mis - match between behaviour and the institutions that  exist now and those required to navigate through a  new context of multilayered uncertainties.65 In addi - tion, the world faces another mismatch between the  availability of information (about people’s actions,  interactions and perceptions, captured through mul - tiple platforms and social media) and our ability to  effectively harness it in processes of social choice.66  Changes to how we produce and share information  are part of a broader social and cultural change. The  ubiquity of information and communications tech - nology today signifies a substantially different world  from just a few decades ago. Technological advanc - es are dramatically altering how people form their  beliefs and values and how these are transmitted  146 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 through social connections and networks. People in - teracting with one another on digital networks are en - gaging in new cultural practices.67 New social groups  and networks can emerge online that are widely dis - tributed and decentralized, involving only loosely  connected individuals. As this section discusses, the  social changes generated by the rapidly evolving (dig - ital) information ecosystem are introducing new vul - nerabilities to processes of public deliberation, even  as they support collective action in other ways. Advances in digital technology are  disrupting social networks In many respects digital social media can support  processes of public deliberation. The free flow of in - formation is fundamental to democratic process - es. Accurate information allows people to develop  well-informed policy preferences, hold those in  power accountable and participate meaningfully in  democratic debate. Information is an important part  of any strategy to address the complex challenges be - fore us. For instance, information about the extent  and scale of climate change is important for spurring  actions to minimize human-induced pressures on the  planet. And technologies for sharing information,  such as social media, play an important role in sup - porting collective action. Digital social media pro - vide new ways for groups to interact, find common  ground and even organize into movements. There  are several such examples of digital media supporting  collective action, from protesting racial or ethnic vio - lence to advocating for workers’ rights and the rights  of gender-diverse groups and indigenous peoples.  Communications technology promises a means for  marginalized, minoritized or threatened groups to or - ganize and effect change. However, recent advances in digital communi - cations technology have also been disruptive to our  social networks, more so than communications ad - vances in the past (box 4.3). There are at least four  key changes in our social systems as a result of rapid  advances in information and communications tech - nology.68 They have dramatically altered the stability  and functionality of social networks. • Changes in scale. Social networks have expanded  massively in scale, to nearly 7 .8 billion people.69  The sheer number of people involved complicates decisionmaking, cooperation and coordination.70  Mechanisms for cooperation or coordination may  be scale-dependent, and new institutions may be  required to meet these functions as social networks  grow so large.71 Changes in scale can undermine  cooperation and impede consensus.72 “ Digital social media provide new ways  for groups to interact, find common ground  and even organize into movements, but  recent advances in digital communications  technology have also been disruptive  to our social networks, more so than  communications advances in the past • Changes in structure. The structure of human social  networks has changed. A large population com - bined with technology that connects otherwise  disparate groups allows for network structures  that were not previously possible. Where humans  had social connections with at most a few hundred  others in the past, online media platforms now  connect much larger networks of people to one  another, as do traditional media sources. Positive  aspects of these networks include the greater  possibility of collaboration across borders, the  diffusion of scientific ideas and expansion of the  networks of those who may otherwise be isolated.  However, some features of these networks, such as  long ties and inequality of influence, can facilitate  harm.73 For instance, these networks can foster  echo chambers and spread misleading or inaccu - rate information. • Information fidelity. New communications tech - nology allows for information to be transmitted  without decay or noise across several degrees  of separation.74 This makes it easy for false and  misleading information to spread fast and widely.  Rapid information flows may overwhelm cogni - tive processes and lead to less accurate decisions.75  Because information is cheaper to produce and dis - tribute, low quality information can spread more  easily. • Algorithmic decisionmaking. Algorithms are widely  used to filter, curate and display information on - line. When designed to share information based on  user preferences and usage patterns, they work as  feedback loops and drive new content exposures  CHAPTER 4 — WHAT’S STANDING IN THE WAY OF OUR ACTING TOGETHER? 147 that become more extreme over time.76 Given  people’s tendency to seek friendly social environ - ments, algorithmic feedback may narrow the infor - mation and networks that users are exposed to: so  they can induce biases in perceived reality and con - tribute to polarization.77 The algorithms that online  media platforms use are typically proprietary, and  there is limited transparency in how algorithmic  decisions for information flows might be altering  human collective behaviour.78 Disruptive changes in information systems  can compromise public deliberation The changes described above are altering processes  of public deliberation. More information and larger networks are not unequivocally empowering. Along - side benign or socially beneficial information flows,  unreliable and unverified information can also be  transmitted with ease through today’s social net - works. One area of concern is the proliferation of mis - information.79 Online spaces have become hotbeds  of politically motivated misinformation, with nega - tive effects on social dynamics and processes, such  as elections80 and treatment of minorities.81 While  misinformation itself is not a new phenomenon, on - line media have increased the reach, influence and  impact of inaccurate information.82 Misinformation  can emerge from a range of actors, including govern - ments, groups and bots designed to convince people  that they are authentic users.83 The spread of false  information can be especially harmful in times of Box 4.3 Advances in digital communications risk destabilizing societies Our species has enjoyed a comparatively stable existence for more than 100,000 years. Humans lived and spread in  loosely connected hunter-gatherer groups numbering in the tens or low hundreds. Our biology at that time was not  fundamentally different from what it is today, exhibiting rich cultural features such as tool use, social bonds, language,  intergroup conflict, art and knowledge sharing. The stability of our species, by almost any measure, changed dramatically with the first agricultural revolution  12,000 years ago. Growing crops and raising animals led many hunter-gather groups to abandon a mobile lifestyle to  form settlements. Organized labour distribution allowed larger groups to coexist in a given geographic area. Convert - ing land for agricultural use provided nutrition to support rapid population growth. Further technological advances  fundamentally altered how most humans interact. Writing, for instance, opened the potential for ledgers, economies,  codified laws and sequestering of wealth. The printing press enabled large-scale distribution of information by those  able to afford the upfront production costs. The Industrial Revolution enabled us to extract and convert natural resources at a dramatically faster pace. Pho - tography, radio, telephony, powered transit and television fostered communication across vast spaces at high speed.  These advances caused subsequent generations to bear less and less similarity to previous ones. Although technol - ogy has brought us many things, stability is not among them. Discussions of digital communications technology, from social media and search engines to artificial intelligence  and cryptocurrency, often occur against this backdrop. Scholars, technologists, politicians and lay people often argue  that the internet is simply our generation’s printing press. Harms are seen as mere growing pains and a far cry from  existential. Our continuing existence is held up as evidence of a collective behavioural invisible hand that will guide  us forward much as it brought us here. However, there are reasons to believe that digital communication technologies today are both quantitatively and  qualitatively distinct from past advances. Engineering decisions that reshape our society can now be deployed in - stantaneously and without oversight to billions of users, dramatically outpacing historical adoption timelines and  creating novel challenges for evidence-based regulation. Further differentiating current advances from past ones,  modern communication technology leverages vast datasets and complex algorithms to couple social systems to  technological ones. Most important, past technological advances have not produced stable social dynamics, particularly in our interac - tions with the natural world. Digital communications technology, while nascent, has more potential than any past  advance to alter social dynamics. Given the precarious state of our natural world and global inequalities, disruptions  that bring about further instability are existential threats for many.

In many parts of the world, waves of un - reliable information preceded increases in Covid-19  infections.84 “ Social media might lead people to perceive  political divisions to be more extreme,  to become more affectively polarized  and enclosed in their own views and to  have hostile or negative discourse about  others be rewarded or reinforced through  increased engagement in social media Human cognition can facilitate the spread and  influence of misinformation. In contrast to mod - els of rational choice, people routinely rely on men - tal shortcuts to bypass some of the information they  encounter when making decisions (see chapter 3).85  Heuristics allow people to reduce the complexity of  these judgments to a more manageable scale. It is in  conjunction with people’s cognitive and behavioural  tendencies that today’s advanced communications  technologies can strain how societies process infor - mation and form beliefs. For instance, that fake posts  spread wider and faster than truthful news online has  been attributed to humans being more likely to spread  fake information rather than to those outcomes being  an artefact of algorithmic choices.86 People tend to  turn towards information that reinforces their exist - ing beliefs  — a manifestation of confirmation bias.  “Repulsion” away from opposing viewpoints is also a  powerful motivator.87 Algorithmic decisionmaking and feedback in on - line spaces can influence the flow of information in  unpredictable, and often opaque, ways. Some design  characteristics of online media platforms can facili - tate polarization. Recommendation algorithms can  shape how information spreads on social networks,  encouraging people to vote against their interests.88  Research from Twitter’s Machine Learning, Ethics,  Transparency and Accountability Team indicated  that their content recommendation algorithms ap - pear to amplify right-leaning politicians across the  majority of countries surveyed.89 Although they could  not identify why the algorithm exhibited this behav - iour, it is conceivable that such unexpected algorith - mic behaviour could affect democratic outcomes in  ways that external observers cannot evaluate.Interactions on social media can increase per - ceptions of difference.90 Selective exposure to like-   minded attitudinal content increases polarization  by reinforcing existing attitudes.91 There is evidence  of political sorting on social networks: people adjust  their online social ties to avoid encountering news  from nonpreferred sources, leading to homogenized  online networks.92 Moreover, negative discourse  about the out-group can get positive reinforcements  through increased engagement on social media in  comparison to language about the in-group.93 Put plainly, social media might lead people to per - ceive political divisions to be more extreme, to be - come more affectively polarized and enclosed in their  own views and to have hostile or negative discourse  about others be rewarded or reinforced through in - creased engagement in social media. Although social  media are certainly not responsible for all polariza - tion, they have provided a space for new tactics and  paths towards misinformation and polarization.94 Polarization harms public  deliberation in uncertain times As the analysis here shows, uncertainty creates fer - tile ground for political polarization, with worry - ing consequences for public deliberation, precisely  when societies must come together to tackle emerg - ing threats. Polarization is much more than simple  differences in preferences or beliefs. After all, differ - ences between groups of people need not impede our  ability to work together and generate sound policy.  Some differences between people are often benefi - cial.95 And holding many different interests, identities  and social connections can constrain social fragmen - tation. Even where people disagree on ideological  grounds or policy issues, they are less likely to expe - rience political isolation by virtue of their rich social  interactions and overlapping identities.96 When peo - ple share beliefs across groups, the space for healthy  interaction and deliberation increases. Rather than a matter of differing preferences or be - liefs, the polarization documented in many societies  today is more pernicious: “the normal multiplicity of  differences in the society increasingly align along a  single dimension, cross-cutting differences become  reinforcing, and people increasingly perceive and  describe politics and society in terms of ‘us’ versus  CHAPTER 4 — WHAT’S STANDING IN THE WAY OF OUR ACTING TOGETHER? 149 ‘them.’”97 In other words polarization has to do with  deepening social divisions between groups, where in - tergroup relationships become hostile and disharmo - nious, distrust between groups intensifies, opposing  groups tend towards more extreme positions and the  scope for cooperation diminishes. In many settings polarization is spilling over into  spaces that would otherwise have been ones of coex - istence, such as families and neighbourhoods.98 When  social networks become segregated, groups have limit - ed information about others’ preferences, diminishing  impulses towards cooperation and coordination. Rath - er than any differences over values, it is the breakdown  in communication between groups that impedes pub - lic deliberation.99 Coming to consensus on issues takes  longer when opposing groups are homogenized, and  deliberation within homogeneous groups tends to lead  people to adopt more extreme positions that they oth - erwise would on their own.100 Polarization contributes  to discontent with democratic systems. In a polarized  society one group (“us”) may see the actions of other  opposing groups (“them”) as impeding its efforts to  shape policy within democratic systems. “ Severe polarization can make  people blind to the fact that there are  strategies where all sides can gain Frustration with democratic processes can be the  result, especially where impulses for collaboration  have already been weakened by processes of group  homogenization.101 Democratic institutions them - selves can struggle to accommodate the priorities of  deeply polarized groups, resulting in deadlocks and  public disaffection.102 In-group–out-group polariza - tion can become a driving factor in supporting author - itarian leaders,103 thus putting democratic processes  under strain.104 Accounting for the rise of radical and  populist parties, scholars have shown that declining  trust in institutions is associated with diminishing  support for traditional insider parties.105 People’s tol - erance for undemocratic actions increases, creating  conditions for democratic decline or even reversal.  There is evidence of the erosion of attitudes towards  democracy and peaceful deliberation in high HDI  countries associated with human insecurity (spot - light 4.2).106 In national politics polarization advan - tages leaders that shun negotiation and compromise and does lasting damage to the norms that underpin  democracy, such as tolerance for differing views.107 The rise in political polarization is occurring in the  context of a long-term, global disaffection with dem - ocratic practices.108 The Varieties of Democracy ap - proach makes an effort to capture this process and  argues that there has been a deterioration of critical  ingredients of democracy (figure 4.5). Freedom of  expression is declining in around 35 countries, more  than three times the number where it is increasing.  Similarly, deliberation is in decline in more than four  times the number of countries where it is improving.  Clean elections, rule of law and freedom of associa - tion are also in decline in more countries than where  they are improving. Severe polarization can make people blind to the  fact that there are strategies where all sides can  gain. Instead, they may end up behaving as though  life is a zero-sum game. This dynamic can be self- reinforcing: “the less they [ people ] undertake joint  collective actions, the more their perceptions of dif - ference, and the more likely it is that they will per - ceive their interests to be zero-sum.”109 Dynamics of  polarization affect not just how people feel about oth - ers who think differently but also how people act. For  example, in the United States social distancing be - haviours, using masks, getting vaccinated and beliefs  about risk during the Covid-19 pandemic correlate  with partisan divisions.110 Polarization also makes in - ternational cooperation harder. For example, party  polarization has negative consequences for national  commitments to international environmental agree - ments.111 We risk losing some of the benefits of liv - ing in plural societies  — a diversity of knowledge and  ideas as well as decisionmaking that is responsive to  as many people and groups as possible.112 Worryingly, polarization is difficult to reverse when it  involves a positive feedback mechanism. When positive  feedback increases (such as political parties adopting  more extreme positions), polarization can ascend to a  tipping point, after which it becomes a self-reinforcing,  runaway process.113 And once it has set in, polarization  is hard to reverse, even in the face of external shocks.114 The discussion in this chapter explains how polari - zation may emerge and persist in a context of uncer - tainty and how the appeal of authoritarian leaders  may increase. But these are not mechanistic and pre - determined outcomes. Greater uncertainty does not  150 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 have to lead to polarization. There are multiple exam - ples in history where uncertainty was faced through  broad collaboration. With uncertainty people can  turn to values that go beyond strategic thinking about  seeking the pursuit of self-interest alone. If there is  trust, that value can be solidarity. Experimental evidence indicates that uncertainty  can affect the morality of individuals. Participants in  experiments appeared less likely to lie and more like - ly to share resources under uncertainty, reducing the  scope for purely strategic self-interested behaviour.115  More important, the power of reasoning and public  deliberation is not diminished in uncertain times,  particularly when the broad notion of capabilities,  emphasizing agency and freedoms, is considered. Breaking the hold of uncertainty  on collective action Political polarization associated with human insecu - rity, and the inadequacy of our institutions in times of change is standing in the way of more decisive joint  action to face common challenges. Despite clear pro - gress on many fronts, human insecurity is putting  people under stress and pulling people apart. Human  insecurity is associated with lower interpersonal trust  and tendencies towards political extremism. Meanwhile, rapid changes in information systems  are a source of added instability in our social sys - tems. Many of the challenges of sustaining informa - tion systems that support democratic deliberation  are not new. After all, the spread of misleading infor - mation, censorship and other impediments to demo - cratic debate existed long before the advent of digital  communications technologies. The difference today  is that our information systems now operate at such  a broad scale that they pose a systemic challenge to  public deliberation, just when our ability to act to - gether to deal with large-scale societal challenges is  so critical. Development progress  — with achievements in dif - ferent dimensions of human development — has gone Figure 4.5 Ten years ago there were more countries where critical elements for democratic governance were  improving than declining — today, the situation is reversed Clean elections Elected oﬃcials Freedom of expression Freedom of association Deliberation Rule of law Judicial constraints Legislative constraints Suﬀrage 05101520253035 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35Number of countries improving2000–2 011 Clean elections Elected oﬃcialsFreedom of expression Freedom ofassociationDeliberation Rule of lawJudicial constraints Legislative constraints  Suﬀrage 05101520253035 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Number of countries declining Number of countries declining2011–2 021 Number of countries improving Deliberative component            Electoral democracy             Liberal component Note: Figure shows the number of countries improving and declining significantly and substantially for different components of democracy.

CHAPTER 4 — WHAT’S STANDING IN THE WAY OF OUR ACTING TOGETHER? 151 along with institutions that have structured human  interactions116 and made that very progress possible.  But as chapter 3 argues, we may be reaching a point  of mismatch between the institutions and social  configurations that have enabled progress up to now  and those required to face new challenges exempli - fied by the uncertainty complex.117 The two process - es contributing to polarization today may reflect this  mismatch  — of institutions inadequately responding  to people’s unsettledness and insecurity and to a rap - idly changing (digital) information context. How do  we break the vicious cycle of increased polarization,  the reduced space for collaboration, the multilay - ered uncertainties? Advancing human development  (in terms of wellbeing and agency, achievements  and freedoms) remains the foundation for shaping  the behavioural and institutional changes needed to  navigate our uncertain times. Expanding capabilities  provides a way to enhance the diversity of voices in - volved in public deliberation to this end, to the extent  that processes of deliberation allow for the full range  people’s beliefs and motivations to be scrutinized and  reasoned. “ Polarization impedes public deliberation,  thereby working against the cooperation needed  to address novel, multilayered uncertainties Polarization impedes public deliberation, thereby  working against the cooperation needed to address  novel, multilayered uncertainties. Two critical ele - ments are deeply interconnected in breaking the hold  of uncertainty on collective action. First, tackling people’s unsettledness and human  insecurity. Thriving under uncertainty requires  human security, overcoming the mismatch between  aspiration and achievements.118 Our ability to im - plement the many transformations needed today  —  local, national and global  — depends on our ability to  agree on what needs to be done, to generate broad  social support and then to implement creative policy  change amid uncertainty. Addressing the basic driv - ers of unsettledness and insecurity in people’s lives is  essential.Existing strategies for human security need to be  upgraded. An expanded concept of human security  for the Anthropocene combines strategies of protec - tion, empowerment and solidarity (where solidarity  recognizes the interdependence among people and  between people and the planet).119 This agenda de - pends on several actions, and there are some practi - cal examples, such as strengthening social protection  systems with built-in adaptive capabilities. Robust so - cial protection not only allows people to better weath - er shocks but also helps sustain people’s wellbeing  and broad participation in decisionmaking. In other  words effective social protection systems can support  agency. To directly address the spread of polariza - tion, policies that seek to counter the feedback cycle  between inequality and polarization are also crucial.120 Second, steering the expansion of social networks  to advance human development. It is imperative to  acknowledge that the digital world occupies a cen - tral role in our social interactions and to set principles  and norms to guide its expansion, so it favours human  flourishing and an equitable and effective collective  deliberation. A hands-off approach is not enough  —  there is little to suggest that an information ecosys - tem organized for narrow private interests (including  boosting engagement, ad sales or short-term profit)  might organically evolve into a space for free, open  and informed collective deliberation.121 Principles of  stewardship, comparable to managing complex eco - systems, have relevance for strengthening our infor - mation systems.122 Within this framework three steps  can be considered: • Increasing transparency over how companies opt  to sort, filter and display information to users. • Improving access and equity in leveraging informa - tion and communications technology. • Enhancing our understanding more broadly of how  new technologies are shaping public discourse and  deliberation.123 As detailed in the following chapter, new oppor - tunities for transformation are emerging against a  backdrop of rapid technological change and the re - cent Covid-19 crisis. Chapter 6 suggests a way for - ward, with a framework for action in uncertain times. 152 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 In our new book, Political Cleavages and Social Ine - qualities,1 we investigate where and how class divides  emerge and how they interact with other social con - flicts (ethnic, regional, generational, gender and the  like). In what contexts do we see inequality become  politically salient and why? What determines the  strength of identity-based divides, and how do these  conflicts interact with the structure of social inequal - ities? Drawing on a unique set of surveys conducted  between 1948 and 2020 in 50 countries on five conti - nents, our volume sheds new light on these questions  and provides a new data source to investigate voting  behaviours in a global and historical perspective: the  World Political Cleavages and Inequality Database  (http:/ /wpid.world ). Among the many findings of the book, three interest - ing facts emerge from the analysis of this new dataset. The intensity of class divisions varies  widely in contemporary democracies We document a gradual decoupling of two comple - mentary measures of social class in many European  and North American democracies: income and ed - ucation. In the early post–World War II decades the  party systems of these democracies were class-based:  social democratic and affiliated parties represented  both the low-education and the low-income elec - torates, whereas conservative and affiliated parties  represented both high-education and high-income  voters (figure S4.1.1). These party systems have grad - ually evolved towards what we can call multi-elite  party systems: social democratic and affiliated parties  have become the parties of higher-educated elites,  while conservative and affiliated parties remain the  parties of high-income elites. In contrast to the gradual decoupling between in - come and education that we find in many European and North American democracies, in other regions  there are large variations in the configuration and  intensity of class divides. These variations can often  be explained by the relative importance of other di - mensions of political conflict. The interaction among  class, regional, ethnic, religious, generational, gen - der and other forms of divides thus plays a key role  in determining the ways through which inequalities  are politically represented in democracies around the  world today. Ethnic diversity is not synonymous  with ethnic conflict Another major finding of our global perspective on  political divides is that ethnic and religious conflicts  vary widely across countries and over time. In par - ticular, more diverse countries are not necessarily  those where ethnic or religious conflicts are more  intense. Instead, varieties of political cleavage struc - tures can be accounted for in part by history, such as  the ability of national liberation movements to bring  together voters from different origins. They also have  an important socioeconomic component: in democ - racies where ethnoreligious groups tend to cluster  across regions and differ markedly in their standards  of living, political parties also tend to reflect ethnic af - filiations to a greater extent. Identity politics take different forms The large variations in class and sociocultural divides  in contemporary democracies point to a more general  pattern. Political cleavages can take multiple forms,  depending on the nature of underlying social con - flicts and on the ability of political parties to embody  these conflicts in the democratic arena.SPOTLIGHT 4.1 Inequality and the structure of political conflict in  democracies: A global and historical perspective Amory Gethin  (Paris School of Economics — École des hautes études en sciences sociales  and World Inequality  Lab), Clara Martínez-Toledano  (Imperial College London and World Inequality Lab), Thomas Piketty  (Paris School  of Economics —  École des hautes études en sciences sociales  and World Inequality Lab) 153 CHAPTER 4 — WHAT’S STANDING IN THE WAY OF OUR ACTING TOGETHER? In European and North American democracies, for  instance, the rise of conflicts over immigration and the  environment have come together with the decline of  class divides and of traditional left-wing parties, per - haps because they are perceived as unable to propose  convincing redistributive platforms. It has also coin - cided with a decline in turnout among low-income and lower-educated voters, pointing to a more general dis - satisfaction among these voters with the functioning  of democracy. Nonetheless, the shift to identity poli - tics observed in many democracies today is neither in - evitable nor generalized. In several countries outside  Europe and North America the class-based dimension  of political conflicts has intensified in recent decades.Figure S4.1.1 The emergence of multi-elite party systems in Australia, Europe and North America 1960– 19641965– 19691970– 19741975– 19791980– 19841985– 19891990– 19941995– 19992000– 20042005– 20092010– 20142015– 2020Diﬀeren ce between share of top 10% educated voting left  and share of bottom 90%  educated voting left Diﬀeren ce between share of top 10% earners  voting left  and share of bottom 90%  earners  voting left T op-income voters voting for  right-wing parties (other parties)Higher-educated voters voting  for left-wing parties (democratic,  labour, social democratic,  socialist, green and the like) Note: In the 1960s both higher-educated and high-income voters were less likely to vote for left-wing (democratic, labour, social democratic, socialist,  green) parties than lower-educated and low-income voters by more than 10 percentage points.

NOTE 1 Gethin, Martínez-Toledano and Piketty 2021. 154 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 SPOTLIGHT 4.2 Support for democracy under strain: Evidence from  very high Human Development Index countries Democratic institutions are means to deliver on  collective choices. Uncertainty can affect this role,  through polarization, which in turn can affect beliefs  about democratic institutions. Overall, support for  democracy is high globally. But the share of people  considering democracy very important is sensitive to  the perceptions of human insecurity, particularly in  very high Human Development Index (HDI) coun - tries and among high-income groups (figure S4.2.1,  left panel). Moreover, people’s justification of violence  as a political tool also appears highly connected with  human insecurity, in particular among high-income segments (figure S4.2.1, right panel).1 Among high- income groups, an insecure person is more than twice  as likely to justify violence or not consider democracy  very important than a secure person. These results in - dicate a potentially destabilizing dynamic of negative  attitudes towards cooperation at the top. This trend  should be of concern, considering that people affected  by high insecurity account for more than 40 percent  of the population in very high HDI countries (even be - fore the Covid-19 pandemic). Why are people in higher HDI countries more sen - sitive to human insecurity (measured by attitudes and  Figure S4.2.1 Support for democracy drops with insecurity in wealthier groups 30.221.212.131.525.721.127.926.922.4 Share of population within group (%)Democracy not very important 26.914.111.420.317.414.118.315.613.9 Share of population within group (%)Political violence justiﬁableAttitudes towards democracy and political violence in very high Human Development Index countries Low Medium HighLow Medium High 0 10 20 30 0 10 20 30Human insecurity levelIncome level Low Moderate or high Very high Note: Values are pooled individual-based data with equal weights across countries.

And because people near the top  of the HDI have known greater human security, they  are likely to feel “entitled” to it and therefore per - ceive insecurity as a loss. This may be a reason why  people in higher HDI countries derive more distress  from human insecurity.3 The feeling of uncertainty across HDI categories  can also be affected by the mismatch between expec - tations and reality: people suffering insecurity in very  high HDI countries and high-income countries are more likely to experience the cognitive dissonance  of development-with-insecurity: income, a meas - ure of worth and success that often guides people’s  behaviour and incentives, cannot in these extreme  cases protect against threats, as could be typically  expected. As market-based mechanisms of security  and regular state-based policies struggle to deliver,  authoritarian approaches might become attractive,  consistent with the earlier discussion on the appeal of  dominant-type leaders.

NOTES 1 All differences between people perceiving very high human insecurity  and people perceiving low human insecurity are statistically significant at  the 1 percent level. 2 The index of perceived insecurity is built using a linear aggregation of in - security threats and cannot account for their subjective impact on people.  See UNDP (2022b).3 The higher sensitivity of wealthier groups to human insecurity is consistent  with the existence of endowment effects (Thaler 1980) — people living in a  context of high human security (both on an objective and subjective basis)  will tend to value more the benefits of a high human security environment  — and with loss aversion (Tversky and Kahneman 1991, p. 1047) — “losses  (outcomes below the reference status) loom larger than corresponding  gains (outcomes above the reference state).” In line with the idea that the  loss aversion theory can be context specific (Gal and Rucker 2018), the  text elaborates further about the meaning of loss in a context of a very  high HDI country. 156 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 PART II — SHAPING OUR FUTURE IN A TRANSFORMING WORLDAdvancing human  development in  uncertain timesCHAPTER 5 158 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022Uncertainty need not be paralyzing. In fact,  it presents opportunities to test the fences of  conventional thinking and to pursue reimagined  futures.  What do those opportunities look like today? How  big are they? As this chapter argues: huge.  Among the many things the Covid-19 pandemic  broke open was our imaginations, from revolutionary  vaccines to unprecedented fiscal and monetary  interventions. Rapidly evolving technologies, such  as artificial intelligence and synthetic biology, and  frontier ones, such as nuclear fusion, could usher  in a new era of prosperity for people and planet.  Opportunities abound. It is up to us to steer them  towards human development.CHAPTER 5 Advancing human development in uncertain times Uncertainty need not lead to negative outcomes. A  context of uncertainty and change can also alter the  reference for what is possible or desirable, opening  new opportunities to expand human development  along the four aspects of capabilities highlighted  in chapter 3: wellbeing achievements (typically the  dominant focus of assessments of progress and pol - icies), wellbeing freedoms, agency freedoms and  agency achievements. Transformational change happens against the  backdrop of the uncertainties discussed in part I.  Some of the implications associated with climate  change are daunting, as the most recent Intergovern - mental Panel on Climate Change assessments have  highlighted.1 But the ability of societies to respond  is not predetermined. A recent model of human be - haviour that looked at the interactions among social,  political, economic, technical and climate systems  found that interactions at the individual, communi - ty, national and global scales could lead to substantial  mitigation action.2 In fact, the reality of the Anthro - pocene is that human agency signals hope to con - sciously manage planetary ecosystems in a way that  eases planetary pressures.3 This chapter calls attention to the potential for ex - panding human development in uncertain times. It  argues that such an expansion can be leveraged in  part precisely because uncertain times provide a con - text where individuals and society see more funda - mental changes as possible or required. Uncertainty  itself can be a source of knowledge to be mobilized  to act differently,4 something that empowers indi - viduals and societies to adopt fundamental changes  in choices,5 that leads people to act according to new  moral codes6 and that can enhance cooperation when  it gives more salience to thinking about the future.7 It  has even been suggested that the greatest source of  political legitimacy may need to evolve beyond pro - cess legitimacy (complying with procedures that link  people’s aspirations and preferences to political de - cisions) and substantive legitimacy (delivering out - comes that matter to people). It can also come from  promissory legitimacy (justifying decisions and per - suading others to act based on claims about what the  future will hold).8 With democracy, uncertainty an - nounces the freedom to choose. By institutionalizing  an iterative and evolving configuration of winners  and losers, uncertainty over political outcomes keeps many different possibilities open, thereby supporting  pluralism and participation.9 Uncertainty can thus  help tap into people’s energy and appetite for change. Uncertainty forces us to make choices  — between  sticking to known paths and exploring new ones,  between yielding to paralysis and polarization or  tackling them head on.10 Both bleaker and more op - timistic scenarios may seem plausible, but the paths  are open and will be shaped by choices. Multiple nar - ratives are being discussed and debated about what  the future holds,11 and this diversity can be mobilized  to enable people to cooperate.12 When old ways of  doing things seem to no longer work and develop - ment pathways seem less obvious than in the past,  the opportunities for rethinking ideas and practices  open up.13 Uncertainty can provide fertile ground for  experimentation, innovation and purposeful trans - formation.14 In other words, it is possible to embrace  uncertainty and not be paralyzed by it.15 We can do  much today to ensure human thriving and flourish - ing, even in times of crisis and turbulence. “ It is possible to embrace uncertainty and  not be paralyzed by it. We can do much today  to ensure human thriving and flourishing,  even in times of crisis and turbulence This chapter considers some of those possibilities.  It explores the example offered by technological ad - vances, arguing that the context of uncertainty pro - vides a space for steering technological progress in  ways that advance human development. It also shows  that times of crisis can alter the horizon of what is  possible. Even amid significant failures, the Covid-19  pandemic has changed our reference points for what  we can achieve in many aspects of life. These are ex - amples of the new possibilities in today’s uncertain  world. Technological innovation  opens new possibilities Technological advances have been behind vast im - provements in human life and flourishing. They have  been the engine of economic growth  — powering the  Industrial Revolution, building cities and allowing  movement of people and goods. The printing press  and photography have expanded human knowledge.  CHAPTER 5 — ADVANCING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 159 Communication technologies have linked people  across vast distances, allowed for rapid dissemina - tion of information and expanded our social connec - tions in large-scale networks. Numerous innovations  in health, from anaesthetics to vaccines, have al - lowed us to live longer and healthier lives. However, technological innovation does not hap - pen in a vacuum, nor does it have a life of its own:  technology is us. Our social, economic and political  choices  — about where innovation can be directed, to  what priorities and to serve which people  — determine  how technology changes and how innovations ad - vance human development. Consider the sobering  case of vaccine deployment during the Covid-19 pan - demic. Advances in science and manufacturing al - lowed for multiple, highly effective vaccines against  Covid-19 to be developed in record time, in a remark - able feat of modern science. But amid a global fail - ure to share vaccines equitably, wide disparities have  emerged: by June 2022 less than 15 percent of people  in low-income countries had received a full protocol  of Covid-19 vaccines, compared with nearly 75 per- cent of people in high-income countries.16 Unequal  access to lifesaving vaccines has had a tragic toll on  human lives and wellbeing. “ Our social, economic and political choices  — about where innovation can be directed, to  what priorities and to serve which people  —  determine how technology changes and how  innovations advance human development This startling disparity in vaccine access reflects  in part patterns in the diffusion of technological in - novations. The share of the population that benefits  is small when a new technology is introduced; then  typically the share grows slowly at first, then increas - es very quickly after a threshold is reached and then  slows down as the share of the population with ac - cess approaches 100  percent  — in what is well known  in technology diffusion studies as an S curve. De - pending on the innovation at stake, often those with  higher income, power and social status benefit from  technological advancements first. This pattern is well  documented, in particular, for health innovations,17  in part because initial adopters have better access to  information.18 Disparities in health outcomes have  been found to increase for diseases with better tools for prevention and treatment, because people with  more resources are better able to use new knowl - edge.19 As such, an acceleration in new health-related  technology can worsen health gradients within and  between countries for a time, even as it eventually  drives improvements at large.20 In terms of Covid-19  vaccines, while the gap between richer and poorer  countries has decreased over time, there is still a long  way to go.21 The initial stage of the technological diffusion  process  — of remarkable improvements alongside  widening gaps  — is eventually closed, not only as tech - nological innovations become more affordable, but  also as complementary changes in economic and so - cial arrangements foster both greater benefits and  lower prices due to further diffusion.22 At the same  time, those excluded as the technology diffuses to a  larger and larger share of the population are doubly  disadvantaged, in that not only do they lack the ben - efits of the innovation, but they are also left outside  what is increasingly the norm. The ongoing digital  revolution is an example, promising to vastly improve  the world’s production possibilities but risking leav - ing a substantial proportion of people excluded and  ultimately worse off if insufficient attention is paid to  those exclusions.23 Past technological advances have generated great  disruptions alongside opportunities and deep anxi - eties about the future, as well as the promise of pro - gress to come. Rapid technological change is part of  the uncertainty complex gripping the world today.  New technologies are upending our economies and  societies, and many aspects of our social systems  will need to adjust before the vast potential of tech - nological innovation can advance human develop - ment. As argued in the 2019 Human Development  Report, these adjustments must unequivocally pay  attention to inequalities if another great divergence  is to be avoided.24 The shift from concentrated ac - cess and wide inequality to convergence over time  depends on social and political choices. Amid tech - nological change as rapid and destabilizing as we are  seeing today, the need for institutional and behav - ioural transformation becomes not only more salient  but also necessary and actionable. Periods of turbu - lence have prompted radical new policies in the past:  in Britain the Industrial Revolution saw far-reach - ing interventions to improve labour and working  160 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 conditions (including regulating work hours and  taxing incomes), which helped convert the structur - al change in the economy into improved opportunity  and wellbeing.25 The initial stages of diffusion are characterized by  growing inequality in access and typically also so - cial dislocation. But this context is an opportunity for  action: the choices made at this stage determine the  trajectory to come. Expanding human development  becomes even more important at this stage, with the  concern for inequalities at the centre, implying that  uncertain times need not be seen as an impediment  to action; rather, they provide a context in which new  possibilities for action emerge. Many of today’s hopes for positive transformational  change rely on technological innovations. New tech - nologies have helped deliver rapid advances in human  development. For instance, in health, antibiotics and  vaccines vastly improved life expectancy in just a few  decades in Africa, Asia, and Latin America; in Europe  the same improvement took well over a century, from  the early 1800s, when such technology did not exist.26  More recent technological advances have been crucial  for curbing human-induced pressures on the planet   — enabling more efficient land use, more sustainable  food systems and a transition away from fossil fuels.  Technological changes affect human capabilities in  multiple ways: they not only expand people’s ability  to do more things (as an enabler), but they also affect  our social context and people’s agency.27 Innovation is  more than new inventions or machines; it is about new  ideas for doing things and taking advantage of exist - ing resources to make those ideas come to fruition. In  this respect innovation is linked to agency  — people’s  ability to act on their values, ideas and priorities. It is  a broad process of transformation, where human initi - ative and creativity interact with social, economic and  political choices. Technological advances are offering  transformative potential Today, several developments in science and tech - nology signal the potential for far-reaching trans - formation. There have been major developments  in computing, biology and energy, as discussed in  chapter 1. These advances are occurring in what has been described as the exponential age, fostered by  remarkable improvements in computing power and  connections across people and machines.28 Expo - nential development in new technologies is not sim - ply about individual inventions  — it is the result of  several new technologies developing in parallel and  nourishing one another.29 In digital technologies  our capacity to generate innovations on the back of  old or existing technologies has greatly expanded.  Many important technologies today are standardized  and interoperable30 — that is, made compatible with  other technologies by design. The internet is based  on standard web protocols, and much modern soft - ware development relies on modular, standard code  blocks. These conditions help make breakthrough in - novations possible. “ Disruptive change in major technological  sectors has the potential to dramatically  alter societies and economies Economic and political conditions are an important  part of this picture. The availability of markets for  new goods and services, facilitated by trade and glo - balization, has helped new technologies diffuse wide - ly. This has enabled us to engage in learning by doing:  more production allows us to learn how to further im - prove the production process. This learning effect is  an essential driver behind the exponential develop - ment of solar power technology.31 Our networks for  sharing information are also larger and more com - plex than ever, facilitating flows of data, ideas and  know-how. Consider some factors that made Covid- 19 vaccines possible, such as global scientific collabo - ration, open data sharing and the release of the latest  research on preprint servers  — all capabilities based  on information networks.32 Spurred by the Covid-19  crisis, advances in mRNA vaccine technology are now  opening new possibilities for controlling disease.33 Disruptive change in major technological sectors  has the potential to dramatically alter societies and  economies. Many new technologies are general pur - pose, with applications beyond a single sector. Gen - eral purpose technologies are transformative because  they create new products and processes and new  ways of organizing economic activity. The general-   purpose technologies of today include new forms of  computing (such as artificial intelligence), among  CHAPTER 5 — ADVANCING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 161 many others, with a dizzying array of applications  for advancing human development. The following  sections consider some of the possibilities offered  by technological advances in energy, computing and  biology. That even the most beneficial advances often gen - erate negative consequences only heightens the  importance of purposefully managing technolog - ical disruption. Technological change is far from  deterministic  — the related risks and impacts and  the prospects for positive transformation are all ulti - mately shaped by social and political choices. Even as  rapid technological change fosters uncertainty, it also  opens space for action. There is enormous potential  to be realized, and with the right policies and actions  in place (as discussed in depth in chapter 6), the fu - ture should be one of remarkable gains for human  development. Renewable energy technologies are  getting better and cheaper Making progress on clean energy is essential for  breaking the patterns of human wellbeing improve - ments generating planetary pressures. Because en - ergy is so crucial to overall human development,  energy consumption is unlikely to ease in the near  future, particularly in developing countries. So, in  the absence of technological advancements towards  plentiful clean energy, there are few viable paths to  mitigating planetary pressures. On the technological front there are remarkable  positive signals both as outcomes and as processes.  New capacity additions were dominated by renew - able energy, accounting for 72 percent of additions  worldwide in 2019.34 The costs of renewable energy  technology and energy storage have declined dramat - ically in recent years. The price of utility-scale solar  photovoltaics dropped by 89 percent from 2009 to  2019 (figure 5.1).35 The price of lithium-ion batteries  has fallen by 97 percent since their commercial intro - duction in 1991.36 Maturing technology contributes  to cost and price reductions. For solar power tech - nology, installed capacity has increased exponential - ly, accompanied by exponential declines in the cost  of solar modules.37 Since the 1970s the unit costs of  solar photovoltaics have fallen by 24 percent each  time the cumulative installed capacity has doubled. The equivalent learning rate for lithium-ion batteries  has been around 20 percent.38 Other energy storage  technologies have followed similarly steep learning  curves.39 Batteries are also becoming smaller and  lighter. Between 1991 and 2018 the energy density  of lithium-ion batteries rose 3.4-fold.40 The dramat - ic cost reductions in renewable energy technologies  have consistently exceeded expectations: contra - ry to the projected average annual cost reduction of  2.6 percent between 2010 and 2020 (based on 2,905  global energy-economy models), solar photovoltaics  costs declined by 15  percent a year over the same pe - riod (figure 5.2).41 There have been major breakthroughs in nuclear  fusion. Leveraging nuclear fusion’s enormous poten - tial will require substantial innovations before it can  be deployed at scale. This transition will take time,  but recent developments provide some grounds  for optimism. There have been important advanc - es in some nuclear fusion experiments, and at least  three may soon generate energy gain factors (the  ratio of fusion power to externally applied heating  power) greater than 1  — the National Ignition Facil - ity and SPARC are expected to do so in the 2020s,  and ITER by 2040.42 In February 2022 scientists at  the Joint European Torus generated more than dou - ble the previous record for energy generated in a fu - sion reaction, a major step towards nuclear fusion  becoming a viable clean energy source.43 There are  also signs of new technologies interacting in ways  that can accelerate progress. Machine learning tech - niques are being used in the tokamak configuration  (a form of magnetic confinement used in nuclear fu - sion research).44 “ Making progress on clean energy is essential  for breaking the patterns of human wellbeing  improvements generating planetary pressures But the path forward is likely to be volatile in the  context of uncertainty that we confront today. Dur - ing the Covid-19 pandemic progress in clean energy  innovation may have been affected by pressures on  public and private budgets, creating a riskier environ - ment for clean energy venture capital and disrupting  global supply chains. Global carbon dioxide emis - sions declined by 5.8 percent in 2020, as the pandem - ic affected demand for oil and coal, but rebounded by  162 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 nearly 5 percent in 2021, approaching the 2018–2019  peak.45 Still, the pandemic could present a unique op - portunity to leverage clean energy innovation, given  the global demand for a greener recovery.46 New  players with new ideas aiming to displace high-car - bon producers and to scale up quickly may find a  supportive environment if they are able to enter the  market at the right moment. Economic stimulus  plans could be an opportunity to boost clean energy  technology innovation. This potential is being un - derused: a review of 75 International Monetary Fund  (IMF) programmes in 65 countries shows that the in - dicator for the green recovery is very low, at 0.59 (on  a scale of 0 to 3).47 Today, there is potential for expansion in this  area. The International Energy Agency’s Energy Technology Perspectives Clean Energy Technolo - gy Guide includes information on the maturity level  of more than 400 technology designs and compo - nents, as well as a compilation of cost and perfor - mance improvement targets and leading players in  the field.48 Some 5 percent of technology designs and  components analysed are at a mature stage. Around  60 percent are not commercially available today, and  35 percent are at the early adoption phase.49 Leveraging artificial intelligence for  augmentation of the demand for labour Rapid advances in computing over the past decade  have drawn attention to the possibilities of power - ful artificial intelligence (AI).

CHAPTER 5 — ADVANCING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 163 opportunities for applying AI are in automation that  augments  — rather than replaces  — demand for human  tasks across various sectors of the economy. AI-based  systems are driving major technological develop - ments in several applications, such as autonomous  vehicles, medical diagnosis and inventory manage - ment, to name a few.50 This means that some tasks  can be performed by machines, but there is little  evidence that machines can replace whole occupa - tions.51 Instead, applications for machine learning (a  subset of AI) that have exploded in numerous fields  are opening an array of new possibilities for advanc - ing human wellbeing. For climate change, machine  learning is aiding in predicting disasters and model - ling climate change impacts, among many other ap - plications. In healthcare, machine learning is offering new ways to detect and diagnose disease.52 Machine  learning applications have the potential to improve  education outcomes through individualized learning  techniques and accessibility applications.53 Augmenting what humans can achieve by using  AI in a complementary way rather than substitut - ing what humans can do offers enormous promise  —  what people can achieve with these machines can be  greater than what people might achieve without them  (figure 5.3). AI applications can supplement human  cognitive tasks. For instance, there is evidence of  AI’s potential for supporting human decisionmaking  through teaching people cognitive strategies.54 By  augmenting the process of technological invention,  AI applications could vastly increase the rate at which  human capacities further expand.55Figure 5.2 Contrary to the projected average annual cost reduction of 2.6 percent between 2010 and 2020,  solar photovoltaics costs declined by 15 percent a year over the same period Capacity cost, 2020 ($/kW, log scale) Levelized cost of electricity, 2020 ($/MWh, log scale) IAM projections reported in 2014 Observed valueNumber of scenarios Improvement rate (%/year) Observed average photovoltaics cost Trend line, 1980–2020 High progress IEA projections High progress IAM projections, 2014 High progress IAM projections, 2018Observed average photovoltaics system cost Approximate photovoltaics system cost (2.5× observed photovoltaics module cost) IAM photovoltaics system ﬂoor costs (shade denotes year reported)1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 2030 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 2040104 103 102104 103 102105 203001,000 500 0 20 10  IAM is Integrated Assessment Model.

The pos - sibility of labour displacement is a source of anxie - ty, as it has been in previous waves of automation.56  AI-induced labour displacement could exacerbate  inequality, both within and between countries.57 But  AI also offers labour-enhancing potential.58 When  machines replace labour, workers’ bargaining power  and influence diminish; in contrast, when AI aug - ments human activity, people remain important for  value creation and continue to wield power and in - fluence. There is some evidence that the augmen - tation effects of introducing AI can outweigh the  effects of automation, but this requires appropri - ate incentives.59 Moreover, introducing technology  can generate new tasks and activities that demand  human labour.60 Most jobs performed today came  into being in part through the task-creating effects  of new technologies: in the United States around  60 percent of people are now employed in occu - pations that did not exist in 1940.61 Expanding AI  into the world of work could similarly generate  new tasks, new occupations and new industries  altogether.Harnessing synthetic biology Advances on several fronts are now propelling what  has been described the Synthetic Age, where biolog - ical systems can be redesigned and re-engineered  for a variety of useful purposes.62 Synthetic biology  builds on advances in multiple fields over the past  decade, including dramatic declines in the cost of  DNA sequencing and synthesis, the development of  sophisticated gene editing tools such as CRISPR and  high-powered computational tools.63 Redesigning organisms to have new abilities could  have numerous applications in health, agriculture,  manufacturing and ecosystem management. Synthet - ic biology is supporting new advances in medicine  —  for treating cancer,64 improving cell-based and gene  therapies65 and developing new drugs.66 In agriculture  there are now possibilities for engineering nitrogen fix - ation in crops and increasing crop resistance to pests  and pathogens.67 Potential applications of synthetic  biology in managing the environment include break - ing down pollutants68 and supporting biodiversity and  habitat restoration.69 There is also potential for devel - oping synthetic alternatives to fossil fuels.70Figure 5.3 Opportunities for augmenting human activity are far greater than opportunities to automate existing tasks Tasks that  humans can doHuman tasks that could be automated New tasks that  humans can do with  the help of machines Note: Figure is illustrative.

CHAPTER 5 — ADVANCING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 165 Times of change come with space  for purposeful intervention In addition to great opportunities, fast-changing  technologies also create new challenges: potential for  misuse, thorny political and ethical issues, and risks  from unintended and even unknown consequences.  For instance, synthetic biology applications such as  human genome editing involve urgent ethical ques - tions.71 Some of the challenges introduced by syn - thetic biology applications are unprecedented in  nature, such as the novel risks of introducing artificial  life forms. Expanding AI applications also introduces  considerable risks. AI and digitization more broad - ly can contribute to the concentration of wealth and  market power.72 Beyond the impact in some sectors  of the economy, using AI to assist human judgement  and predictions in several domains (health, educa - tion and governance to name a few) introduces new  risks, including of algorithmic bias and discrimina - tion (see chapters 1 and 2).73 “ Given the speed at which technological  advances are unfolding, there is the risk  that, without appropriate incentives  and regulation, new problems might  accumulate just as rapidly while long- standing ones are further exacerbated The potential of these technologies, coupled with  the new challenges they pose, increases the impor - tance of purposefully steering technological progress  in ways that expand human capabilities. Indeed,  given the speed at which technological advances are  unfolding, there is the risk that, without appropriate  incentives and regulation, new problems might accu - mulate just as rapidly while long-standing ones (such  as inequalities) are further exacerbated. Many new  technological advances reflect what has been consid - ered an era where societal implications are exceed - ingly complex and require sophisticated governance  and policymaking.74 New social and ethical ques - tions might unfold faster than appropriate responses  can be formed.75 Moreover, the Covid-19 pandem - ic has generated an enormous setback for human  development progress. It is in this context that the  double-  edged sword of technological change must be  wielded carefully.These conditions highlight the importance of pur - posefully advancing the full potential of new technol - ogies for human development. For instance, rather  than leaving the evolution of new technologies up to  markets or to the narrow incentives of a few actors  alone, actively steering new technologies towards  expanding human capacities is essential. Policy and  regulatory interventions are important in this respect,  as is a broader evolution of norms for responsible in - novation and avoiding harm. Opening spaces for  broad deliberation and overcoming the gulf between  technical and social debates on new advances will be  essential for advancing the human development po - tential of the disruptive new technologies.76 A context of uncertainty can provide the conditions  in which such actions become possible. Navigating  our current reality will require new ways of thinking.  In these conditions opportunities emerge to rethink  old ideas and practices and to experiment with dif - ferent ways of doing things. For instance, it has been  suggested that managing technological disruption  today demands rethinking competition policy and  antitrust regulation.77 Things that once appeared im - possible or infeasible are becoming possible in gov - ernance, science, technology and innovation. Indeed,  as the next section discusses, times of crisis can alter  our reference points for what we can achieve  — and  open new avenues for action in uncertain times. The Covid-19 pandemic:  A window into a new reality The Covid-19 pandemic has exerted a vast human  toll, not only through loss of life but also through  long-term damage to economies and communities.  It is the greatest global crisis in human development  since World War II. Harmonized information since  1950 for income per capita and life expectancy shows  the magnitude of the crisis and its global character in  historical perspective (figure 5.4): in 2020, 85 percent  of countries experienced a decline in income per cap - ita, and 70 percent of countries and territories faced a  reduction in life expectancy at birth. The comparison  of income and life expectancy also reminds us of the  importance of looking beyond income: despite signif - icant economic recovery in 2021, the health crisis in - tensified, with two-thirds of countries recording even  further reductions in life expectancy at birth. 166 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 The Covid-19-Adjusted Human Development  Index quantifies the depth of the crisis from a multi - dimensional perspective. The index retains the  standard Human Development Index (HDI) dimen - sions but modifies the expected years of schooling  indicator to reflect the effects of school closures and  the availability of online learning on effective at - tendance rates.78 The Covid-19 pandemic touched  nearly every person in the world, with all regions  facing declines (figure 5.5). In 2020 the world ex - perienced a loss in Covid-19-adjusted HDI value  equivalent to more than one-fifth of the progress  from 1990 to 2019. Latin America and the Caribbe - an was the most affected region, losing in one year  the equivalent of 30 percent of its pre-Covid-19 pro - gress since 1990. In 2021 there was a recovery, but it was partial  and uneven. For very high HDI countries the 2020 Covid-  19-adjusted HDI shock was not as large as  across other country groups, but it was more sus - tained, with a slow recovery in 2021. Crises on such a large scale hold up a mirror to so - cieties. Covid-19 has laid bare the vast prepandemic  disparities in people’s ability to cope with shocks to  access healthcare and to rebuild from loss. The pan - demic has exposed the fragilities in global coordi - nation mechanisms in pandemic preparedness and  response. The Independent Panel for Pandemic Pre - paredness and Response found “gaps and failings  at every critical juncture of preparedness”: contain - ment measures that were too slow, a lack of coordi - nated global leadership, emergency funding that  took too long to materialize, and large holes in social  protection systems.79 The unequal access to lifesav - ing Covid-19 vaccines demonstrated a tragic failure  of global solidarity.80 These failures played a role in Figure 5.4 The Covid-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented synchronized and multidimensional crisis 0102030405060708090 1951 1953 1955 1957 1959 1961 1963 1965 1967 1969 1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021Share  of countries and t erritories with a yearly reduction in income per capita (red) or life expectancy at birth (blue) (%) Reduction in life expectancy at birthEconomic contraction  (based on income per capita) Note: Based on countries with available data in each year.

CHAPTER 5 — ADVANCING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 167 the pandemic’s disproportionate impacts on people  around the world. Yet, even as crises mirror weaknesses and injus - tice, the current crisis also shows us that there are  opportunities. Wars, pandemics and disasters can  trigger far-reaching change. The 1918 flu pandemic  helped spur investments in medicine in some coun - tries, and the bubonic plague triggered efforts to im - prove sanitation and working conditions.81 At other  times shocks have fostered repressive or harmful  policies or not resulted in change.82 Opportunities  for positive transformations are context-specific  and far from inevitable (box 5.1). The next section  suggests that amid significant collective failures  the world’s response to the pandemic offers new  possibilities for transformation. In our response to  Covid-19 are new reference points for what we can  achieve in times of crisis  — triggering breakthrough technological innovation, delivering inclusive social  protection and changing social norms. New reference points for technological breakthroughs Less than two years after the novel coronavirus strain  was identified, multiple highly effective vaccines  against Covid-19 were deployed around the world.83  The availability of vaccines for Covid-19 was a cru - cial turning point. The speed of developing these  vaccines  — just 11 months after the SARS-CoV-2 se - quence was published  — is a remarkable achievement.  This outcome was made possible in part by years of  scientific work, including three decades of prior re - search into RNA-based vaccines, now deployed for  the first time to tackle Covid-19. The history of mRNA  vaccine development starts in the 1960s.84 But only Figure 5.5 Widespread but unequal declines in Covid-19-adjusted Human Development Index (HDI) value: Regional and  group aggregates 5.92.510.98.4 8.58.025.521.76.914.4 3.35.8 5.110.9 18.530.4 8.024.6 7.623.49.421.7 0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0 30.0 35.0Very high HDIHigh HDIMedium HDILow HDIArab States East Asia and the Paciﬁc Europe and Central Asia Latin America and the Caribbean South Asia Sub-Saharan AfricaWorld Loss in Covid-19-adjusted HDI since 2019 (% oftotal gain in 1990–2019)2020 2021 Note: The Covid-19-adjusted HDI retains the standard HDI dimensions but modifies the expected years of schooling indicator to reflect the effects of school  closures and the availability of online learning on effective attendance rates.

Commercial research and development started  only in the late 1990s, with the US Defense Advanced  Research Projects Agency financing a large part of  the research. This long history of development made  possible vaccine development from when the pan - demic started. Even as these advances in vaccine technology  built off a pre-existing foundation, the Covid-19 emergency injected an unparalleled sense of urgency  into scientific work, producing a systemic shift in sup - ply and demand. Addressing the pandemic through  vaccination became a mission, and vaccine supply  chains emerged.85 Moreover, thanks to the steady  reduction of DNA sequencing time, many coun - tries could receive current information on prevailing  strains of the virus and to act accordingly. Publication  pipelines worked overtime to keep up with the rapidly Box 5.1 The Covid-19 pandemic as an opportunity? A call for a contextual approach Do shocks create opportunities for policy change? How can the Covid-19 pandemic help ensure that in the future  most of the population has access to clean water, sanitation, healthcare, school services and other social benefits  as a matter of right? These questions have surfaced in the aftermath of a pandemic that upended all dimensions of  everyday life. Progressive policymakers, social activists and international organizations have identified the current  crisis as an opportunity to promote radical policy change. An important body of research identifies shocks as triggers for policy change. Pandemics have also generated  opportunities for change as early as the 14th century, contributing to the growth of public institutions and the modern  state.1 The extent to which pandemics have triggered opportunities for inclusionary change has depended at least  in part on the role of ideas — including scientific ideas — and how they have shaped the narratives regarding policy  responses. Each narrative is a story about a problem and its sometimes-obvious solution.2 Analytic frameworks that move beyond grand proclamations about how shocks enhance opportunities for inclusive  social policies can be useful. To determine whether such policies have created longer term opportunities, we propose  focusing on three key variables. First are the incentives that the policy tools themselves create.3 Second are the  responses to shocks that can also modify the distribution of power among state actors. Third are the narratives that  are particularly important as a mechanism for change — one that deserves special attention here. In this way ideas are  a power resource to define what the problem subject to state intervention is, frame possible and desirable outcomes  and lead policy implementation.4 Opportunities are context-specific and revolve around the combination of narratives, policy tools and pro-equity  state actors. Take the emergency cash transfers under the Bono Proteger programme, which buffered the sudden  loss of income in Costa Rica. The pandemic, along with high uncertainty and fear of social unrest, lifted constraints  and made space to implement new policy measures. The programme empowered state entities focused on advanc - ing social goals and created openings for new narratives and policy tools.5 A second lesson is that the pandemic may  leave as many challenges as opportunities when narratives of austerity, including the claim that more taxes are not  politically possible or even desirable, take hold. This reminds us of the power of the idea that states should live within their means, which often also implies that  they should avoid increasing taxes as much as possible. Austerity is as much a scientific idea as it is a moral impera - tive linked to moderation and sacrifice.6 It alters the relationship between the state and citizens and has become a  powerful tool against serious attempts towards redistribution.7 In recent decades, austerity has become appealing  for conservative political actors critical of the welfare state, because it is “politically more expedient to argue that the  government lives above its means than to directly attack the poor.”8 To further advance and fight this dominant narrative, much needs to change. The combination of state weaknesses  and pro-status quo actors (such as the economic elites) that ended up inhibiting rapid use of the opportunities cre - ated to expand inclusive social policy should be analysed further.

CHAPTER 5 — ADVANCING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 169 emerging research.86 The rate of Covid-19-related  therapies in research pipelines and the academic pub - lication rate of Covid-19 articles exceeded that of re - cent Ebola, Zika and H1N1 crises by at least an order  of magnitude.87 The success of vaccine development shows that  governments, industry and academia can work to - gether to great effect in a crisis. Regulatory processes  were deployed to support the acceleration of clini - cal development, trials and emergency use author - ization. Governments provided large investments  in manufacturing capacity and in supporting private  research and development. Manufacturing pipelines  were developed alongside clinical trials to allow for  rapid scale-up. Government investments helped sup - port development of several potential vaccine can - didates, increasing the odds that at least a few might  be successful. The United States and Germany were  the largest investors in vaccine research and develop - ment, providing about $2 billion and $1.5 billion re - spectively to pharmaceutical companies.88 Covid-19  also propelled major technological advances in our  ability to develop vaccines for future diseases: novel  RNA technology appears set to permanently trans - form how vaccines can be developed and manufac - tured in the future.89 New reference points for social  protection and economic policy In the more than two years since the SARS-CoV-2  virus was first identified, governments have adopted  new and unprecedented policy measures to protect  vulnerable populations and national economies from  lasting damage.90 Instruments of economic policy have been de - ployed at an extraordinary scale. In August 2021  the IMF issued $650 billion equivalent in new Spe - cial Drawing Rights, the largest in the fund’s history   — even if the process took much longer than what  would have been feasible. The new Special Drawing  Rights provided vital support for national economies  as governments battled the health and economic  damage the pandemic wrought. A G20-sponsored  Debt Service Suspension Initiative granted 73 coun - tries temporary relief on debt-service payments until  December 2021. Government fiscal responses were among the largest in recent history, totalling $16 tril- lion in support between April 2020 and April 2021.91  These resources were poured into helping house - holds and businesses survive the crisis through a  variety of instruments, including direct transfers, ex - panded benefits, payment deferrals and liquidity in - jections. To deliver these massive financial support  measures, governments moved to rapidly upgrade  existing social protection systems and develop new  facilities, such as for digital payments. “ The response to the Covid-19 pandemic has  reminded us how people-centric policies can  substantially enhance human wellbeing The response to the Covid-19 pandemic has also  reminded us how people-centric policies can sub - stantially enhance human wellbeing. As the pandem - ic’s economic, social and health impacts mounted,  governments around the world deployed a flurry  of expansive social protection measures to support  people through the crisis. More than 1,600 social  protection measures were reported across virtual - ly all countries and territories in February 2020 and  January 2021.92 The scope and scale of these meas - ures were unprecedented in many settings. In sever - al countries governments expanded protections for  losses of livelihoods and income (see monetary sup - port measures in figure 5.6). Many began to extend  direct transfers, in the form of cash payments and  guaranteed income. Where transfer programmes al - ready existed, governments increased benefits and  expanded coverage to include more recipients.93 By  the end of 2020, cash transfers had reached nearly  1.1 billion people worldwide, with coverage growing  by 240  percent on average relative to prepandemic  levels.94 By some estimates almost 17 percent of the  world’s people saw at least one Covid-19-related cash  transfer payment between 2020 and 2021.95 Several  countries delivered one-off payments to their pop - ulations on a universal or near-universal basis.96 In  addition to cushioning the blow of lost livelihoods,  income support programmes helped stem the spread  of Covid-19. In low-income countries income sup - port measures were found effective in reducing the  growth rate of Covid-19 cases, and in middle-income  countries they helped reduce both case growth rates  and deaths linked to Covid-19.97 170 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 Many social protection schemes saw unprecedent - ed expansions in scope, reaching groups that have  been excluded from support in the past, such as in - formal sector workers and the self-employed.98 Gov - ernments of several countries provided food aid,  delivering baskets of staples and essential foods to  households for free.99 Some suspended routine pay - ments and contributions, including for utility bills,  loans and pension schemes. Mobile payment systems  were deployed to deliver financial support — in Bang - ladesh, Jordan and Mali for instance  — to minimize  the need to visit banks and service providers in per - son. Countries turned to online application systems  to reach as many of their citizens as they could. Brazil  expanded coverage for households already registered  as potential beneficiaries and then registered about  27 million households within a few weeks through an  online system.100 Since Covid-19 triggered a public health crisis,  measures to expand health coverage were deployed  around the world (see health measures in figure 5.6).  Several countries sought to ensure that facilities to  identify, diagnose and treat Covid-19 were readily  available at low or no cost. Many countries sought to close gaps in health coverage by expanding existing  schemes to cover additional segments of their pop - ulations, such as temporary and migrant workers.  Paid sick leave and other forms of support were ex - panded, such as compensation for earnings lost due  to self-isolation and quarantine.101 These efforts reflected the urgency of the crisis,  and emergency measures are unlikely to remain in  place indefinitely, as figure 5.6 seems to confirm. But  they have demonstrated that inequalities and gaps  in social protection are not insurmountable. They  have shown that governments can do more to make  social protection a reality. And they have shown that  interventions in income security and healthcare in  particular can make an enormous difference to peo - ple’s lives. The Covid-19 pandemic may have helped  broaden public appreciation for social protection and  improve government experience with delivering it.  And it has added to a growing evidence base on the  effectiveness of relatively untested social protection  measures, such as guaranteed basic incomes. The Covid-19 pandemic has also brought previous - ly neglected concerns to the forefront of the reform  agenda. Bridging digital disparities has become more Figure 5.6 Most countries implemented monetary support and health measures during the Covid-19 pandemic 0102030405060708090100 January 2020July 2020January 2021July 2021January 2022July 2022Share o f countries (%) Monetary supportHealth measures Note: Figure tracks the “flow” of active policies across around the world, displaying the percentage of countries that had any active monetary and  health measures in any given month during the Covid-19 pandemic.

CHAPTER 5 — ADVANCING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 171 urgent than ever, as the pandemic made affordable  internet access essential for education as schools  closed (recognizing, though, that it should not be  seen as a replacement for in-person education). Gov - ernments around the world ramped up e-government  facilities to continue delivering essential government  services, manage new demands (including adminis - tering expanded social protection programmes) and  provide dedicated Covid-19 information portals.102  Living with Covid-19 is providing new impetus to  digitalization efforts, bolstered by a renewed aware - ness that going online can create new possibilities for  public administration and that strengthening internet  access and infrastructure could be essential for resil - ience against future disasters.103 Tools such as nowcasting (providing real-time in - formation about economic and social processes as  they unfold, as opposed to waiting for official statis - tical information) are already gaining traction in ef - forts to understand and respond to the fast-moving  crisis presented by Covid-19. Alternative data sources  such as mobility data, congestion data, mobile pay - ment patterns and internet search activity are being  incorporated into models for understanding outbreak  patterns and economic activity.104 This spate of policy activism, through ramped up  social protection and new delivery mechanisms, may  have reset public expectations of what governments  are able to do, at least for some people. If sustained,  a new mindset about what governments can do for  people opens new possibilities to transform econom - ic policy thinking and approaches as we confront the  challenges ahead. New reference points for altering norms and behaviour Covid-19 showed us that people all over the world are  willing to dramatically alter their everyday conduct in  service of a common purpose. Although responses to  the Covid-19 pandemic became the focus of divisions  in society sometimes associated with political polari - zation, as discussed in chapter  3, there was remarka - ble and unprecedented behavioural and institutional  change. Combating the spread of Covid-19 required  a range of social and behavioural changes such as so - cial distancing, contact tracing, masking and restric - tions on gatherings. These changes could not have been sustained without voluntary cooperation from  the vast majority of the world’s population. A sur - vey of people in 58 countries during the early stages  of the pandemic showed high voluntary compliance  with several behavioural measures: 91 percent of re - spondents reported that they did not attend any so - cial gatherings, 78 percent said that they stayed home  in the week before the survey and 93 percent said  that they would have informed people around them if  they experienced Covid-19 symptoms.105 A different  study of pandemic-related behaviour in 28 countries  in August 2020 found that 58 percent of respondents  reported always or frequently avoiding having guests  in their homes and that 78 percent reported always or  frequently avoiding crowds.106 “ Covid-19 showed us that people all over the  world are willing to dramatically alter their  everyday conduct in service of a common purpose Behaviours that were exceedingly rare in many  societies becoming commonplace, such as wearing  masks, suggests the emergence of new social norms.  This means that people are motivated not only by  the need to protect themselves but also by a sense  of shared responsibility, a perception that others are  doing the same or the possibility of social disapprov - al for noncompliance. People in several countries  reported feeling proud of their contribution to stop - ping the spread of Covid-19 and believing that they  were setting a good example by wearing a mask.107 A  variety of interventions based on new social norms  engendered by Covid-19 can be considered for fu - ture disease control, including normalizing paid sick  leave, voluntary social distancing and self-isolation in  the event of exposure to infection.108 *   *   * The foreseeable future remains one of uncertainty.  Social upheaval, climate and environmental crises  and rapidly changing technology may be here to stay  for some time. The Covid-19 pandemic has given us  a glimpse of the kinds of reality we may need to con - front. It has also shown us who we are in times of cri - ses, how we can mobilize with a sense of common  purpose and how we may yet shape our common des - tiny. The extent to which we succeed in this era of un - certainty is up to us. 172 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 Our ability to manage this new reality will be  strengthened only with a new resolve for far-reaching  change. The pandemic has disrupted the world, and  it is unlikely, even undesirable, that things will return  to how they once were. And there is much more left to  do. Our response to the crisis has shown us some of the  possibilities for ensuring that the world will be more  just and resilient. We have seen that it is possible to  substantially reorient people’s relationships with gov - ernments and that this reorientation can deliver enor - mous improvements to people’s lives. The pandemic  showed that social protection can work better where  it corresponds to how people actually live, work and navigate times of crisis. We saw how people possess an  immeasurable capacity to care for one another  — and  how our ties to one another provide an invisible infra - structure for human flourishing. We saw also that our  ability to spur technological innovation can dramati - cally expand our possibilities for surviving and thriv - ing. More than any single technology or invention,  it is our capacity for innovation at large that matters  the most. Technological advances will be vital for the  structural changes needed in our economies and soci - ety. The direction of technological change remains up  to us, and much can be achieved by turning its poten - tial to tackle the challenges we face. CHAPTER 5 — ADVANCING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 173  Charting paths to  transformation Navigating uncertainty to expand  human development PART II — SHAPING OUR FUTURE IN A TRANSFORMING WORLDCHAPTER 6 176 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022CHAPTER 6 Charting paths to transformation:   Navigating uncertainty to expand human development The hero and the villain in today’s uncertainty story  is one and the same: human choices. So, what practical choices can be made for the  better? This chapter emphasizes policies that focus on the  Three I’s: investment, insurance and innovation.  Together, these will promote, protect and stimulate  human development for people and planet to flourish  in the face of new uncertainties. Culture plays a big role, too. The chapter identifies  three enablers of cultural change: education to  cultivate evolving values, social recognition to  legitimize them and representation to protect their  inclusiveness and translate them into policies. Enhancing human development—by expanding free - doms and achievements in wellbeing and agency—is  an open-ended process filled with new possibilities.  Uncertainty is part of that journey, and as human in - genuity pushes forward the frontier of the possible,  new unintended consequences are bound to arise,  good and bad. And new challenges can mean room  for new opportunities. To thrive under uncertainty,  as important as averting the negative consequences  of well-intended actions, is to grab the opportunities  that emerge. Today we seem to be living through several un - intended consequences of progress, as reflected in  part in the three layers of uncertainty—the danger - ous planetary changes in the Anthropocene, the un - predictability in uncharted transitions, and the social  division and polarization of societies. Our choices  and the values that underpin them have at times pro - moted socially, economically and environmentally  unsustainable policies and development paths. Ine - qualities have allowed a few to benefit while many get  left behind. “ Our choices and the values that underpin  them have at times promoted socially,  economically and environmentally  unsustainable policies and development paths The image of the “empty box” in chapter 1, with  no country so far achieving a very high Human De - velopment Index (HDI) value with low pressures on  the planet, suggests that our societies need to devise  new ways of pursuing development. Chasing higher  GDP per capita or even higher HDI values alone is  not enough. The call is thus for transformational change, which  requires enhancing social arrangements to address  people’s insecurity and unsettledness. But this pro - vides only a partial response. We are not confront - ing a small adjustment or transitory imbalance. We  are navigating uncharted territory, where social and  planetary systems are adjusting simultaneously. The  assumption in much economic analysis that all other  conditions remain unchanged does not hold. Transformational change may be needed be - yond policies and institutional arrangements. Soci - eties also might need to shift social norms, beliefs  and values (introduced in chapter 3 as culture). The Dasgupta Review on the economics of biodiversity  argues for ensuring that societies’ demands on nature  do not exceed nature’s sustainable supply, for adopt - ing different metrics of economic success and for  transforming our institutions and systems—particu - larly those in finance and education—to enable these  changes and sustain them for future generations.1 But  the review goes further, coming to a startling conclu - sion: “No social mechanism can meet this problem  in its entirety, meaning that no institution can be de - vised to enforce socially responsible conduct.”2 The problem is that humans are embedded in na - ture, so current and future wellbeing depends on  maintaining the integrity of the biosphere, yet peo - ple’s conduct is undermining that very integrity. As  if this were not challenging enough, the Dasgupta  Review argues that “unlike the economics of cli - mate change, […] the economics of biodiversity […]  requires not only national and intergovernmental en - gagement, but engagement by communities and civil  societies throughout the world.”3 How, then, can such  a problem be solved? If these conclusions are star - tling, the recommendation on what to do may seem  even more so: “It would seem then that, ultimately,  we each have to serve as judge and jury for our own  actions. And that cannot happen unless we develop  an affection for Nature and its processes.”4 Social mechanisms to address collective problems  usually rely on appealing to people’s interests (such  as price incentives to tax pollution) or creating in - stitutions (property rights over land or a specific re - source, such as a forest). Interests and institutions  clearly matter, but the headline recommendation of  the Dasgupta Review can be interpreted to take us to  the world of ideas—or of culture (chapter 3). And why invoke the relevance of ideas, of culture,  now? Many communities in history have had a deep  affection for nature. Chief Elesi of Odogbolu living in  Nigeria stated in 1917: “I conceive that land belongs  to a vast family of which many are dead, few are liv - ing and countless others unborn.”5 The 2020 Human  Development Report documented how indigenous  peoples over time have held—and today in many  communities around the world continue to hold—be - liefs and values that reflect “an affection for Nature  and its processes.”6 Many are persecuted and killed  when their actions based on such beliefs come into  conflict with interests shaped by existing institutions,  CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION 177 from mining to expanding agriculture.7 But now  the challenges that we confront go beyond climate  change and preserving the integrity of biodiversity  functions: these are but two of the manifestations of  our Anthropocene context. In addition to dangerous planetary change, the  other layers of uncertainty documented in this Re - port are unsettling people’s lives. The conflicts that  play out at the local level between indigenous peoples  and firms or authorities are a microcosm of a broader  set of tensions that may not be resolved by arbitrating  between competing interests. It seems reasonable to  suggest, in addition to re-examining policies and in - stitutions (which is typically the remit of work such as  the Human Development Report), that the cultural  context—the ideas, broadly defined to include prac - tices, beliefs, norms, values and technologies—also  bears re-examining to explore a way forward as we  navigate today’s uncertain world. Examining culture opens new vistas for the range of  possible actions by those in positions of power and the  potential for new social mechanisms to address the  unprecedented challenges we are confronting today.  But that requires two things. First is broadening our  perspective on the determinants of people’s choices.  And second is reflecting on more recent perspectives  about what culture is, how it changes across contexts  and over time and how it is used by people in strategic  ways, rather than as a fixed latent variable working si - lently in the background. Key for both is recognizing  the importance of agency and freedom, the tenets of  the human development approach (chapter 3). A framework to embrace uncertainty Navigating the uncertainty complex demands dou - bling down on human development to ensure that  people have the capabilities to harness the poten - tial embedded in uncertain times. “The cunning  of uncertainty opens new spaces and facilitates the  emergence of alternative options. Ambiguities per - mit boundary crossings where closure between  knowledge domains or areas of strictly defined ex - pertise have reigned. Ambiguities do not mean that  everything becomes fuzzy and porous or that any - thing goes. They mean acknowledging that social life  is full of contradictions and that social beings have  the ability to navigate between them. Once they have the necessary resources, they also negotiate with  each other viable options for living together.”8 “ Navigating the uncertainty complex demands  doubling down on human development to ensure  that people have the capabilities to harness  the potential embedded in uncertain times We propose a two-tier framework to respond to  a dual gap in our uncertain times. On the one hand,  a mismatch between current social arrangements  struggling to promote human security and to tack - le people’s unsettledness. On the other hand, a mis - match between prevalent beliefs and values and what  might be needed to navigate through the uncertainty  complex (figure 6.1). The first tier is about what to do, with a focus on  concrete transformations on three fronts: invest - ment, insurance and innovation. • Investment, in the capabilities people will need to  enable socioeconomic and planetary conditions for  human flourishing. • Insurance, to protect people from the unavoidable  contingencies of uncertain times, safeguarding  their capabilities, including their fundamental  freedoms (enhancing human security). • Innovation, to foster capabilities that might not  exist today. The second tier is about how to generate the broad - er social and contextual conditions for change to take  hold, acknowledging the role of culture as described  in chapter 3. • Education, to strengthen agency and encourage  people to shape their own future. • Recognition, to acknowledge human rights and  respect for people’s identities and values to change  scripts and narratives that build hope in society. • Representation, to amplify the power and voice  that strengthen representation and agency. Insights from cultural change suggest cultivating  motivating principles that can both enhance social ar - rangements and shape cultural evolution in uncertain  times.9 The motivating principles highlighted in this  Report are flexibility, creativity, solidarity and inclu - sion (spotlight 6.1). No single set of policy recommendations can suit  every context and every country, but using these princi - ples as a compass can help navigate through the layers  178 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 of uncertainty and inspire people to embrace uncer - tainty. Flexibility, creativity, solidarity and inclusion  build pathways to transformation by strengthening re - silience10 and agency,11 as they increase communities’  capacity to thrive in environments characterized by  change. For instance, in the context of societal respons - es to Covid-19 in the G7 countries, differences in soli - darity and agency were much more marked than in the  economic and environmental policies pursued, point - ing to the importance of supplementing economic poli - cies with solidarity- and agency-enhancing actions.12 Investment, insurance and  innovation towards continually  expanding human development Thriving under uncertainty is possible. Three policy  building blocks that would shape transformations to expand human development could provide support  in facing the layers of uncertainty from dangerous  planetary change, uncharted transitions and polari - zation. The first is investment, encompassing people  and financial and natural resources. The second is  insurance mechanisms that guarantee protection or  compensation in the case of shocks or threats ema - nating from planetary imbalances or insecurities and  that can bring a greater sense of control. The third  is innovation, to embrace change, looking for new  solutions through creativity, iterative learning and  diverse perspectives. Investment, insurance and in - novation all safeguard and promote agency, thus ad - vancing human development. Implementing these  mechanisms aims to grow opportunities for the fu - ture while advancing human potential in the present.13  Figure 6.2 identifies some of the policy examples ex - plored below.Figure 6.1 A two-tier framework for transformation Cultural mismatches  (values, beliefs and social norms)Gaps Responses Investment Insurance InnovationEducation Recognition RepresentationInadequate institutions  and policiesPlanetary change Transition uncertainty PolarizationThree layers of uncertainty: Changing culture  (values, beliefs and  social norms)Enhancing social  arrangementsMotivating principles: ﬂexibility, creativity,  solidarity and inclusion Source: Human Development Report Office. CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION 179 Investment—in capabilities to  thrive under uncertainty The first building block encompasses investment in  the capabilities required to successfully navigate an  uncertain future. It includes policies focused on en - hancing capabilities as well as on forming the assets  to do so—meaning different forms of capital, includ - ing natural capital. The context of multilayered uncertainties sets  up new challenges but also new possibilities for the  long-standing aspiration to provide global public  goods.14 On the challenges the three layers of un - certainty render investments in global public goods  more difficult: the planetary scale of the Anthropo - cene’s challenges generates a mismatch with the  geographic scope of national governments,15 while  political polarization and transition uncertainty com - plicate how domestic priorities are weighed against  international challenges. This was made starkly clear  during the Covid-19 pandemic, as the world strug - gled and failed to ensure universal access to personal  protective equipment and then vaccines, despite hav - ing the scientific, technological and financial capaci - ties to make the investments needed to do so.16 But the uncertainty complex also makes the case  for investing in providing global public goods more  compelling. The additional investment to avoid fu - ture pandemics is estimated to be $15 billion a year.17 This is a tiny fraction of the economic cost of the  Covid-19 pandemic (without considering any human  cost in lives lost or learning lost): more than $7 tril - lion in lost production and more than $16.9 trillion in  emergency fiscal responses.18 The investment is also  very small compared with the $650 billion dollar is - suance of special drawing rights.19 The rational case  for investing in global public goods has been made  many times, as has the need to craft appropriate ar - rangements that sustain international coordination  or cooperation.20 But with the recognition of the uncertainty com - plex lies the opportunity to look across the interac - tions of the layers of uncertainty and not only work  through formal existing structures and rules but also  encourage experimentation and innovation.21 This  can be advanced by recognizing that providing global  public goods in a context of novel uncertainty can be  enhanced with institutions of multilevel governance  offering compelling narratives that foster coopera - tion and coordination through the legitimacy of en - visioning better futures.22 These institutions would  embrace uncertainty, which means adopting policies  and strategies robust to many alternative futures.  Normative goals—if formulated with participation,  flexibility to iterate and informed rigorous research— could help produce assessments that offer more ro - bust policy options beyond just alerting the world of  the extreme possibilities to come.23 They could be Figure 6.2 Making people more secure though investment, insurance and innovation Opportunities for broad participation Macroprudential policies Social protection  Access to basic services Protection of human rights Public deliberationAdaptive peacebuilding Social innovation Addressing misinformation and enhancing media literacy Data and measurementsEnergy eﬃciency Insurance InnovationInvestmentProvision of global public goods Nature-based human development Preparation to face environmental changes Source: Human Development Report Office. 180 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 even more robust if these assessments took a holis - tic view, focusing on the behaviour of the individual  components and agents in socioecological systems as  well as their interactions and relationships.24 Investment is also essential in complex governance  systems (governmental and beyond) that can exper - iment, respond quickly, draw on all relevant knowl - edge and account for heterogeneity of societies, while  overcoming the power imbalances that entrench vested interests. This would promote inclusion and  build trust for sustained collective action and solidari - ty (box 6.1). Investing in governance also means craft - ing systems that can redress inequality and provide  individual and group recognition to enable dignity by,  among other things, strengthening social policies and  fostering civic (re)engagement and participation.25 Investment is also needed in nature-based human  development, including bottom-up efforts that rely  Box 6.1 Governance for systemic and transformational change The Anthropocene represents a complex set of crises of a kind humanity has not previously confronted. Human  impact on the planet and unsustainable economic and social systems virtually guarantee environmental and societal  upheaval for the foreseeable future. Every polity will experience the effects for generations to come.  Complexity theory helps us understand what it takes to manage such systemic problems: holistic analysis, constant  experimentation and the inclusion of many disciplines and perspectives. But our existing governance processes  are designed largely to sort people and issues into siloed boxes onto which “optimal” procedures can be applied,  sandpapering away the diversity and volatility that characterize reality. It is entirely possible to govern for the complex systemic problems we confront.1 Such governance must focus not  just on the behaviour of individual components and actors in interrelated systems but also on their interactions and  relationships.2 It must adopt policies and strategies that are robust to alternative futures and adaptable in the face of  rapid change. Specifically, it must aim to (re)build social capital at scale, build meaningful networks across decision  silos and create effective, inclusive layers of governance that keep decisionmaking as close to local knowledge  as possible. To those ends governance should be based on four principles: systemic thinking, transparency, social  inclusion and subsidiarity. The most important change that Anthropocene governance requires is the shift to systemic thinking and decision - making. Some of the actions decisionmakers can take are mapping the system using social or organizational network  analysis;3 employing tools such as scenario-based planning for a variety of alternative outcomes and conditions;4 and  continuously monitoring, evaluating and assessing the impact of policies. Transparency in governance refers to the degree to which information is available to all stakeholders and enables  them to have an informed voice in decisions and assess the choices made by insiders.5 It is essential both for ac - countability and for making governance effective and responsive, as meaningful transparency permits feedback on  how well policies and experiments are working and what adaptations may be needed. Inclusion in governance refers to expanding meaningful participation to a wide array of stakeholders and ensuring  they have both deliberative and decisionmaking powers. Governance must prioritize inclusivity for three reasons: it  is necessary for reducing power imbalances, networks with a diverse and distributed structure are more resilient to  shocks and disruptions, and greater inclusion fosters legitimacy. Subsidiarity made possible by adequate transparency and inclusion then becomes a key principle for creating re - silience in a multilayered governance structure. It refers to how “social and political issues should be dealt with at the  most immediate level consistent with their adequate resolution.”6 If practised well, governance based on subsidiarity  can bolster the efficacy and legitimacy of policy responses because local authorities tend to be physically closer,  more connected and more visible to the people they serve. Governance based on these principles gives humanity its best shot at effectively and justly transforming the exist - ing systems for creating, using and disposing of the material substrate of human society. Such governance has the  potential to shift us towards greater adaptability, to strengthen the societal trust that is key to effective governance in  challenging times and to improve prospects for sustainable development in the Anthropocene.

CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION 181 on the inclusion, participation and knowledge of local  communities and indigenous peoples,26 leveraging  their potential to both learn and scale up transform - ative change.27 Examples include investing in green  areas to manage the risk of extreme temperatures,  reducing ecosystem-based disaster risk, improving  water quality, ensuring water availability and improv - ing agricultural practices to ensure food security. The  value of these efforts often goes beyond the contribu - tions to communities. So, instead of treating them as  isolated initiatives, countries should integrate them  into national development priorities across domains,  including water security, food security, disaster risk  reduction and economic performance. Nature-based  human development both relies on and can enhance  the agency of local communities and indigenous peo - ples; it also provides for diverse visions of what is a  good life, incorporates justice and inclusion in con - servation and promotes education and knowledge  sharing.28 “ Investing in mechanisms that prepare local  communities to face rapid environmental changes  such as food insecurity can increase agency and  freedoms by fostering inclusion and solidarity Investing in mechanisms that prepare local com - munities to face rapid environmental changes29 such  as food insecurity can increase agency and freedoms  by fostering inclusion and solidarity (spotlight 6.2). Insurance—against the interacting  layers of uncertainty Insurance guarantees protection or compensation  against shocks emanating from the interacting layers  of uncertainty. A key goal is to enhance human se - curity. As chapter 4 describes, human insecurity not  only constrains agency and fundamental freedoms  but also hinders collective action. People have always  confronted adverse outcomes—illness, death or in - juries that preclude someone from providing for the  household—and extended families, friends and local  communities have often been a source of support. Charities or religious institutions have some - times helped. Groups engaged in dangerous occu - pations such as mining established mutual societies for an injured or incapacitated member of the group  to receive support from the others, and some mar - ket insurance eventually developed out of these  arrangements. It is critical to expand market insurance, under  properly regulated frameworks that protect users and  address several of the well-known market failures in  insurance markets (including moral hazard and ad - verse selection). Equally important, market insur - ance providers will face the challenge of innovating  to offer services that address the novel context of un - certainty, for which existing actuarial practices may  not be fully adequate. It is also crucial to expand, and innovate in, social  insurance. Over the 20th century government-fund - ed social insurance programmes expanded around  the world. Public social welfare spending in Organi - sation for Economic Co-operation and Development  (OECD) countries grew from a median of 0.4 percent  of GDP in 1900 to 18.6 percent in 2017 . Private (man - datory and voluntary) social welfare spending has also  increased in recent decades, from a median of 1.1 per- cent of GDP in OECD countries in 1980 to 2.1 percent  in 2017—reaching more than 10 percent in the Neth - erlands, Switzerland and the United States.30 There is great diversity across countries in the level  and categories of spending, in the mix of taxation to  fund government programmes and in the reliance  on private provision. But the bulk of the increase in  OECD countries is related to contributory social in - surance programmes to support older people and to  pay for healthcare expenses, with both workers and  employees contributing to fund government pro - grammes. Denmark and New Zealand rely, instead,  on general tax revenues only. Most striking, howev - er, is how much less spending there is in non-OECD  countries: total social protection spending increased  from a median of 4.5 percent of GDP in 2000 to only  6.3 percent in 2015 in 46 countries that account for  most of the world’s population. In several African  countries less than 3 percent of the population living  in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution  is expected to rely on support from governments or  nongovernmental organizations—and the rest were  most likely to rely on family and friends (box 6.2).31 Macroprudential measures can be implemented  to promote financial stability, in part learning from  the lessons of the global financial crisis. Most central  182 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 banks have stability objectives, and they apply dif - ferent tools that work as insurance instruments to  build resilience.32 The most common mechanisms are  countercyclical capital buffers and capital require - ments, which serve as a shock absorber, sector-spe - cific capital requirements for the banking sector, and  loan-to-income or loan-to-value ratios that increase  bank capital above the minimum.33 Although in most  countries these instruments are under the Central  Bank’s control, in some (such as Brazil and South Af - rica) decisionmaking responsibility is shared. Not all  countries have the same mechanisms available—for  example, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia,  Peru and Türkiye use other prudential instruments  such as reserve or cash requirements on domestic de - posits. Reducing the costs of future systemic shocks  and containing vulnerabilities require building mac - roeconomic prudency and coordinating with mone - tary policy.34 Approaches such as state-contingent debt instru - ments can help economies respond to shocks quickly  and predictably. These instruments enable countries  to manage their sovereign debt payments depending  on changes in their capacity to pay as a direct result of  shocks.35 Mexico, Nigeria and Venezuela have linked  these instruments to commodity prices (such as oil prices); Argentina, Greece and Ukraine have linked  them to GDP variations; and Barbados and Grenada  have linked them to the effects of natural hazards.  State-contingent debt instruments act as insurance  that gives countries the space to apply countercyclical  and stabilization policies that are immediately trig - gered after well-specified adverse events take place.  After the event, and by contract, either the maturity  or the volume of payments to creditors (or both) is ad - justed to give more fiscal space to the sovereign debt - or. Creditors can count on a predictable response as  specified in the contract, as opposed to being subject  to ad hoc and unpredictable processes of potential  debt restructuring.36 Access to financial services can greatly contribute  to people’s abilities to navigate changing and uncer - tain economic conditions. Financial inclusion can re - duce poverty and inequality through access to credit  and insurance.37 Moreover, digital banking and pay - ment, loan and credit services enable wider finan - cial inclusion, especially among underserved groups  and in low- and middle-income countries.38 Financial  literacy is an important accompaniment to greater  financial inclusion because it develops tools, knowl - edge, confidence and awareness related to person - al and business finances. Important state-led and Box 6.2 The heightened importance of expanding and innovating in social protection Expanding and improving social insurance, recognized as important for a while, acquire heightened relevance in  today’s uncertain times. Social insurance enhances human security and can stimulate risk taking and investment,  supporting other elements of institutional change and policies. The reverse also holds: some investments can provide  insurance. For instance, investments in nature-based human development can be an effective tool for achieving  resilience to shocks.1 Key policies in this area relate to social protection2 that can shield people against shocks, achieving a dual purpose:  protection and promotion.3 The need to balance both raises questions about the appropriate mix of targeted and  universal policies. The interaction of inequalities, hierarchical power imbalances, polarization and conflicts can com - plicate reaching consensus for social policies.4 Social protection income and providing public goods can reduce in - equality while preventing political polarization, potentially reversing entrenched polarized attitudes.5 So it is important  to deliver mechanisms that reach everyone, independent of economic status. For instance, a social protection model  that was born to tackle social protection simultaneously with climate adaptation and disaster risks is adaptative social  protection.6 Adaptative social protection builds safety nets (savings, insurance, information) to prepare households to  act on unforeseen situations, so they can smooth consumption, retain assets and reduce exposure to shocks.7 Notes 1. Dasgupta 2021; DeFries 2020; UNDP 2020a.  2. Social protection is concerned with protecting and helping those who are poor, marginal - ized or dealing with increased risks. Social protection includes a set of measures provided by the state, such as social assistance (noncontrib - utory transfers in cash, vouchers, in-kind, free waivers and subsidies), social insurance, social care services and labour market programmes  (Carter and others 2019).  3. Drèze and Sen 1989.  4. Ravallion 2017.  5. Stewart, Plotkin and McCarty 2021.  6. Arnall and others 2010; Bahadur  and others 2015; Davies and others 2013.  7. Bowen and others 2020. CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION 183 private initiatives exist to strengthen these capabili - ties—for example, by incorporating financial literacy  content in education curricula.39 One of the main challenges policymakers face is in - adequate coverage of the people most likely to be left  behind. Targeted social policies that are based on in - come can easily exclude informal workers. Such pol - icies might have requirements that leave individuals  at higher risk of slipping through the cracks.40 With  these challenges combining with other recent threats,  such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the focus of the de - bate has shifted more to universalism. An example  to take advantage of the structures that have already  been built is the implementation of systems that ben - efit all, such as universal access to health, education,  care or income.41 A minimum guaranteed income has been tested  through pilot projects in India, Kenya and Namibia.42  One of the main operational challenges for these pro - grammes is that they are financed by taxation, and  countries with lower incomes have limited formal tax  systems and income data.43 Another concern is that  a minimum guaranteed income does not provide an  integrated solution across other human development  dimensions, so it could divert resources from other  government-subsidized or universal services, such as  education, and distort economic incentives. Howev - er, a universal basic income needs to be seen not only  in the context of the world today—in which limited  government resources and acute needs may tilt the  argument towards targeted transfers—but also as pre - paring for the world of tomorrow, when the nature of  future work may change.44 Many have advocated shifting the debate towards  universal basic services, to guarantee that everyone  meets their basic needs and has expanded opportu - nities and participation independent from contin - gencies.45 Universal access to services can still lead  to inequalities in human development. And as the  recent Special Report on Human Security points out,  universalism must consider equity and quality and  not just cover essential needs.46 In some countries  health and education are already built on universal  basic service principles, but this can be expanded to  housing, care, transportation, information, securi - ty and nutrition.47 Universal access to mental health  services48 enables people to deal with mental distress  and thrive, and these services could be offered within existing social structures, such as schools and com - munity centres. “ Good practices in promoting human rights  point towards identifying what binds us  together and engaging people in dialogue  about human rights in their daily lives Universal basic services are also based on solidar - ity, as it recognizes that needs and the responsibili - ty to fulfil them are shared in the collective. A study  of 19 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean  determined that policies across the region explicitly  mention that no child or adolescent should be left  out of the education system and designed method - ologies based on the Universal Design for Learn - ing.49 In El Salvador’s Modelo Escuela Inclusiva de  Tiempo Pleno, flexible pedagogic programmes were  adapted for different students based on inclusion  principles.50 The study also highlights that the chal - lenge for inclusive education is achieving not just a  technical change but also a social change. When ap - proaching universal policies in practice, it is impor - tant to consider all actors (teachers, administrators,  parents), create local support networks and trans - form the institutional culture with a shift in attitudes  and norms.51 Protecting human rights can work as insurance by  shielding people in times of uncertainty (box 6.3).  Mechanisms that rebuild trust and promote under - standing,52 respect, inclusion and equality can help  in navigating conflicts and impacts of displacement.  In some cases policy design and programme selec - tion that consider human and environmental rights  can be helpful in a context of contested and uncertain  futures.53 Examples include strategic impact assess - ments, regulatory impact assessments and cost-ben - efit analyses that consider both international and  local regulations, such as access to water and full citi - zenship and recognition of people who identify as les - bian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex or another  sexual minority (LGBTQI+).54 Good practices in promoting human rights point  towards identifying what binds us together and en - gaging people in dialogue about human rights in  their daily lives.55 Practices such as volunteerism and  policy mechanisms that favor inclusion and that en - hance deliberative processes can also be interpreted  184 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 as advancing insurance (spotlight 6.3) in addition to  promoting human rights. Innovation—expanding societies’  chances to thrive in uncertainty Innovation refers to mechanisms that look for new  approaches through creativity and iterative learn - ing drawing from diverse perspectives. As chapter  5 mentions, technological innovation can expand  societies’ chances for thriving in uncertainty. It is  important to prioritize investments in research and  science to push the frontiers of knowledge and mo - bilize technological change to complement, and not  replace, people. As chapter 1 highlights, it is also  fundamental to innovate responsibly, addressing justice and sustainability seeking to avoid power  concentration. Peacebuilding is one space where innovative ap - proaches are being applied to manage complexity.  Born out of new understanding of complexity and  resilience, adaptive peacebuilding prioritizes itera - tive learning to sustain peace, where peace is seen  as a continuous process rather than an end.56 Draw - ing on insights from complexity theory, the approach  recognizes that peacebuilding must respond to con - tinuously changing circumstances. The objectives for  peacebuilders then become working with communi - ties and people affected by conflict, facilitating the  creation of self-organized and resilient social institu - tions that can embrace uncertainties and channelling  nonviolent responses to stressors and shocks.57 This  is achieved through participatory decisionmaking, Box 6.3 Navigating uncertainty—the human rights anchor In a context of uncertainty, it is extremely difficult (maybe impossible) to think of ideal scenarios or optimal policies.  Even more so in a context of a plurality of views, where decisions are heavily affected by cultural context and emo - tions (chapter 3).1 Amartya Sen advocated that it is possible to make progress in assessing policy objectives without  necessarily searching for the conditions of an ideal world. The key is to identify “clearly remediable injustices.”2 Not  an easy task, either. But humanity has made remarkable progress in defining some normative principles that should  remain valid in the new context. Probably the most important consensus is encoded in the internationally agreed 1948  Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Human rights and human development are linked.3 Their concepts have a common motivation, and several human  rights can be seen as rights to capabilities. However, capabilities tend to refer to the opportunity to choose among  different alternatives for what one would like to do (opportunity freedoms), while human rights also encompass the  chance to choose freely (process freedoms).4  In times of change and deep uncertainty, human rights become even more salient to guide our collective actions  for three main reasons.  First, in a context of deep social and planetary transformations, is that they retain the focus on people.  Second is their emphasis on fundamental freedoms, which depend not only on achievements but also on the  agency of people (a dimension that has often been missing in public discussions; see chapter 3). In this space hu - man security is a subset of these fundamental freedoms (freedom from fear, from want and from indignity), explicitly  mentioned in the preamble of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Third is their universality. This defines a space of equality across all people on the planet. The 2019 Human Devel - opment Report highlights that this condition (inherited by the description of several Sustainable Development Goals)  allows the analysis of inequalities to be refocused beyond income, including on the gaps in agency and freedoms.5  The 2020 Human Development Report underscores that the lack of recognition of human rights amid dangerous  planetary change can perpetuate discrimination and injustice and makes navigation harder in the Anthropocene  context.6 The universality of human rights also ensures their validity in the expanding digital world. This is critical for protect - ing the right to participate in the cultural life of communities, the right to freedom of expression while addressing  online hate speech and disinformation, and the right to privacy.7  Notes 1. As indicated in the introduction of this chapter, in these times humans will have to serve as judge and jury for their own actions (Dasgupta  2021).  2. See discussion in Sen (2009b).  3. Sen 2005.  4. Sen 2005.  5. UNDP 2019.  6. Leach and others 2018; UNDP 2020a.  7. Bachelet 2022. CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION 185 constant iteration and variety of solutions.58 Lessons  from church-based groups, local nongovernmental  organizations and government initiatives for adaptive  peacebuilding in Rwanda point to focusing on local  needs for transitional justice. Religious institutions  facilitated spaces for Hutu, Tutsi and Twa to come  together and process their grief and honour their  loved ones after the genocide. Civil society leaders  encouraged Rwandans to take advantage of their cul - tural repertoires for healing. Through  kwihangana,59  communities achieved conflict resolution through  patience and gift giving. Local nongovernmental or - ganizations focused on tackling socioeconomic con - ditions and the mental health of women who had  faced sexual violence. The government implemented  efforts to resonate with local adaptive peacebuilding  strategies,60 teaching reconciliation in schools and  providing a space for commemoration and public  memory. Because shocks, crises and conflicts can have seri - ous effects on mental wellbeing, they should ideally  be prevented. This is not always possible, but meas - ures can be implemented to mitigate crises, and in - novations can help improve mental wellbeing—for  example, mechanisms that connect mental wellbeing  to peacebuilding or psychological resilience building  techniques.61 (See spotlight 6.4 for an elaboration of  the framework “Preventing distress, mitigating cri - ses and building resilience” introduced in figure 2.9  in chapter 2). “ Even well-  intended policies can overlook  conditions that affect the groups most likely to  be left behind. In these cases social movements  and community initiatives innovate and  experiment with alternative views, codes,  values and practices using symbols, teach-ins,  educational workshops and awareness raising Urban communities are likely to have stronger  networks due to the high density and proximity of  services, actors and resources,62 which set the con - ditions for innovative initiatives. In India it is very  common that in the name of solidarity, communities  mobilize to establish small-scale decentralized com - posting plants. The Residents’ Initiative for a Safe  Environment started in Bengaluru with 1,200 house - holds coordinating waste separation and collection at composting sites. The initiative depended on engag - ing many households without external support and  on their willingness to contribute financially.63 Innovation requires creative energy to address  complex problems through community interactions.64  Dangerous planetary change and new threats are  pushing some countries to transition to clean energy  systems. In India one of the challenges of distributing  energy is rural areas, so the country has introduced  the National Solar Mission, with mechanisms to en - courage community-based off-grid projects.65 Two  initiatives based in the provinces of Rajasthan and  Uttar Pradesh have attempted different solutions to  bring electricity to their communities. Innovative organized actions can strengthen the  individual and community repertoires and power, in - fluence decisionmakers and transform traditional so - cial norms and cultural behaviours. Community involvement can also ensure that pol - icies reflect people’s priorities. Even well-  intended  policies can overlook conditions that affect the  groups most likely to be left behind. In these cases so - cial movements and community initiatives innovate  and experiment with alternative views, codes, values  and practices66 using symbols, teach-ins, educational  workshops and awareness raising.67 In Israel a wel - fare-to-work programme was implemented to benefit  the long-term unemployed, requiring all adults from  beneficiary households to participate full time. But  the programme did not account for the needs of those  dependent on unpaid care work. A local group of men  and women in one of the areas that lack day-care fa - cilities started advocating for their right to participate  in the labour market and to have access to care. The  group organized a participatory needs assessment to  express the needs of the community.68 This example  aligns with inclusive localism, focused on empow - ering and investing in the capabilities and agency of  local communities.69 Innovation can also result from recombination or  iteration.70 Initiatives such as Thinking and Working  Politically and Problem-Driven Iterative Adaptation  have an advantage when the problem is complex, the  context is novel or the solutions are contentious.71 For  instance, the organization Funda Wande was created  based on the fact that 58 percent of children in South  Africa were unable to read for meaning in any lan - guage at the end of grade 4.72 The organization aimed  186 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 to improve children’s reading skills. Using the itera - tive adaptation approach73 to deconstruct the prob - lem, it identified four main causes: weak institutional  functionality, undue union influence, weak teacher  content and pedagogical skills, and wasted learning  time. “ Another area that requires innovation  is tackling misinformation. Major social  media platforms have enacted policies  such as notices, warnings and links  to resources on misinformation Local actors, native language speakers, teachers  and other relevant stakeholders were brought in for  another diagnosis, which identified teacher train - ing and reading materials as action entry points. In  Eastern Cape and Limpopo, two of the worst per - forming provinces, iterating and revising practices  led to teaching materials being produced in local lan - guages, thereby adapting them to each setting. Only  a cheaper set of materials in native languages would  accomplish widespread readership. The organization  currently runs its programme in 30 schools in Eastern  Cape, 80 schools in Limpopo and 50 schools in West - ern Cape.74 Another area that requires innovation is tackling  misinformation. Social media have transformed the  methods, speed and scale of spreading misinforma - tion, especially where it is organized and intention - al (spotlight 6.5). Major social media platforms have  enacted policies such as notices, warnings and links  to resources on misinformation. For example, links  to official information by the World Health Organi - zation are suggested under posts mentioning Covid- 19 on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.  And Twitter alerts users who share an article without  opening the link first. At the same time fact-checking  initiatives have been created by users of these plat - forms, and media plurality has been strengthened  through new and independent outlets that could not  exist or have the means to inform in the tradition - al media landscape, often at the local and grassroot  levels. Innovation is also important when it comes to new  ways of measuring human development (box 6.4).  Motivated scientists can fulfil a social role75—for ex - ample, in contributing to green transitions through advocating for taxes on pollution.76 Committed re - searchers and scientists who let their values guide  their work are a powerful force, as they can draw so - ciety’s attention to the perils of climate change77 or  other development challenges. In this sense there  is also a need to expand the research and measure - ment of social norms (perceptions and values),78 as  understanding them is also key to socially coordinat - ing people.79 Beyond data collection, research is de - veloping models to predict social norm change and  methodological tools to test the causal effect of social  norms.80 Drawing from cultural change For investment, insurance and innovation strategies  to promote agency and advance human develop - ment, opportunities for common deliberation to ac - company cultural change are important (figure  6.3).  Building a solid institutional capacity open to di - versity and deliberation can be seen as insurance in  uncertain times. Under uncertainty, mismatches be - tween current and needed institutions can emerge.81  Strengthening intergroup contact82 can reduce hos - tilities against other parties and provide opportuni - ties for common deliberation that fosters cultural  change.83 Education, social recognition and representation84  are some of the ways stakeholders can encourage cul - tural change supportive of investment, insurance and  innovation.85 Education to cultivate evolving values Education—a powerful tool to instil reasoning and  critical thinking, opening possibilities for new values  and attitudes in younger generations—is key for agen - cy. It can encourage people to act regarding climate  change and other Anthropocene pressures, providing  them with ownership and agency to shape their own  future and hold decisionmakers to account.86 Govern - ments and other organizations have explored myriad  education curricula to shape the next generations’  wellbeing. One is comprehensive sexuality educa - tion,87 an approach that schools around the world are  implementing to improve sexual reproductive health,  prevent dating violence and increase understanding  CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION 187 Box 6.4 Augmenting the resolution of the Human Development Index values using satellite imagery and artificial  intelligence Data collection to measure human development is challenging. It is difficult to get accurate and high-quality informa - tion for some regions across the globe. In this context remote technology and satellite imagery can help researchers  and decisionmakers observe, explore and evaluate the status of human development1 in a timely, consistent and  affordable way2 and can fill gaps in official statistics.3 The availability of geolocalized and satellite imagery data can inform decisionmakers of where to implement  policies, who to target and how to allocate resources efficiently.4 For example, targeted policies or programmes that  require monitoring Human Development Index (HDI) values at the local level. The United Nations Development Pro - gramme (UNDP) estimates HDI values at the national level based on country-level data, but some countries produce  subnational estimates. There have been prior efforts to measure HDI values locally, producing a snapshot at the state  or province level using survey and administrative data,5 but these remain spatially coarse and expensive to produce.  A recent collaboration between UNDP and academic researchers uses daytime and night-time satellite imagery  to estimate HDI values at highly disaggregated geographic resolution (box figure 1).6 Using a machine-learning  technique, it is possible to train an artificial intelligence algorithm that associates image elements with HDI values,  employing these image elements to estimate HDI values at the local scale.

Never- theless, new measurement tools are promising and have great potential to be scaled up, with appropriate bench - marking and data calibration.7 Combining satellite imagery and machine learning is an exciting direction for future  research to expand how the HDI is used for decisionmaking.

The curriculum has contributed to the normalization  of same-sex romantic relationships and the reduction  of homophobia and homophobic bullying and har - assment in schools. It has also led to shifting norms  around intimate partner violence, leading to the re - duction of such cases as a result.88 Discussions of the role of education for change in  social norms envisage schools as a space that em - bodies inclusion and diversity. Teaching practices  also affect students’ beliefs and trust in institutions.  Education not only dictates the content of students’  learning—the what—but also the how and with  whom. The how relates to teaching practices that  have an impact on student beliefs and world views. In  some cases educational attainment shapes one’s be - liefs. Across countries women with higher education - al attainment are less likely to believe that husbands  are justified in beating their wives if they argue.89 In  addition, research sheds light on how different teach - ing styles have divergent impacts on students’ values.  Students who are taught with horizontal teaching  practices that entail working in groups on projects are  more likely to participate in civic life, believe in coop - eration with others and tolerate different ideas.90 The question of with whom students receive educa - tion is equally critical. Education that provides space for students of various backgrounds contributes to  norm changes, especially tolerance for differences and  diversity.91 For example, students can understand by  their lived experiences that gender does not determine  one’s ability to learn or perform. Teachers’ attitudes to - wards female students also affect how students view  equality among the sexes. In India, when the govern - ment of Delhi made a policy to provide at least 20 per - cent of the seating in elite schools to students from  low-income households, students with high economic  status were more understanding and had less discrim - inatory views against the poor students.92 Hence, regu - lar personal interactions enabled by the inclusion and  diversity policy in education destigmatized economi - cally marginalized individuals. By the same token, efforts to prevent violent ex - tremism through education aim to use education to  create a space for inclusion and a sense of belonging  for young people at risk of joining violent extremist  groups. Here, education serves as an alternative for  such young people, as one underlying driver to join  violent extremist groups appears to be feeling exclud - ed and marginalized in the community and seeking a  sense of belonging in militia groups.93 Education also  provides new knowledge and fosters critical think - ing to strengthen students’ resilience and prevent  them from subscribing to extremist ideologies when Figure 6.3 Accompanying cultural changes with education, recognition and representation Educational curricula Schools embodying diversity  Horizontal teaching practices  Build teachers’ capacity Prevent violent extremismsIncrease diversity  in public spaces Transitional justice Support social movementsEqual participation in  decisionmakingHuman rights laws Change scripts and narratives Media campaigns to prevent discrimination Reduce mental health stigma Education RepresentationRecognition Accompany cultural changes Source: Human Development Report Office based on Lamont (forthcoming). CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION 189 exposed to them. It can thus be a catalyst for norm  change and an instrument that empowers students to  shape new norms and culture. Recognition to enhance legitimacy Social recognition can be accomplished through  changes in laws and regulations to recognize human  rights, media campaigns to raise awareness or chang - es in policy narratives to recognize the interest of  right holders and respect for their identities and val - ues. Take policies on recognizing same-sex relation - ships. A recent study using data from the European  Social Surveys evaluated the change in narratives and  attitudes towards different sexual orientations in Eu - rope after 17 countries legalized same-sex marriage  and 11 legalized same-sex civil unions. Individuals  living in countries with legal recognition of same-sex  relationships showed more positive attitudes towards  LGBT people. These results are consistent with legit - imacy models, where legal recognition legitimates a  group in society and attitudes towards the group ad - just as a result.94 “ Social recognition can help change  scripts and narratives to portray groups in  different ways and build hope in society Social recognition can help change scripts and nar - ratives to portray groups in different ways and build  hope in society. Climate change activism among in - digenous young people in New Zealand has faced  multiple challenges to transforming narratives, such  as anthropocentrism, racism, adultism or generic  recommendations to fight planetary change. Never - theless, through activism and changes in education  Māori youth narratives based on stories of coloni - zation and indigenous systems of values and beliefs  have had a ripple effect, enabling children and young  people to feel a sense of hope and empowerment.95  “Governance of climate and natural resources emerg - es best when rooted in stories about human purpose,  identity, duty and responsibility.”96 Nondiscrimination mechanisms can enhance an  individual’s ability to choose. These include prevent - ing those most likely to be left behind from being  discriminated against in access to resources such as health, education, land, natural resources, and labour  and financial markets. Media campaigns to prevent  discrimination, reduce stigma or promote narratives  that influence power balance are examples. Con - sider the high rates of violence against women and  girls in East Africa. A recent innovation randomly  implemented a media campaign across 112 villages,  reaching more than 10,000 citizens. Results from in - terviews several months after the experiment showed  an increase in the willingness to report violence  against women and girls to the authorities.97 Media campaigns can also reduce discrimination  and stigma, contribute to equal access to resources  and increase freedoms and agency. In Bangladesh  a popular animated television programme, Meena,  portrayed a nine-year-old female lead who dreamed  of learning and discovered her math and writing  skills through the episodes. The programme reduced  the cultural and religious stigma of girls going to  school in rural areas and increased their attendance.98  It focused on describing how religious and cultural  practices can generate discrimination and affect girls’  lives and health. By influencing beliefs around girls  accessing education, the narratives could balance  power and change social norms. More attention is needed as well to dismantle stig - matization of mental health, which can be achieved by  changing social norms and narratives.99 In Ghana and  Kenya the Time to Change Global campaign tackled  stigma and discrimination against mental health, dis - seminating on social media videos of real experiences  with stigma and myths about mental health. Accord - ing to an evaluation, there was a significant positive  impact: in Ghana the desire to socially distance from  people with mental health challenges was reduced,  and in Kenya knowledge of mental health increased.100  Narratives can thus work as lenses that allow people  to look at mental health from a different perspective. Representation to advance inclusiveness Finally, representation, power and voice can foster  people’s ability to influence and participate while  encouraging others. Increasing the representa - tion, power and voice of diverse experiences in  public spaces, institutions, governance processes,  leadership positions, art, film, photography, music  190 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 and writing can shape the definitions of who mat - ters, foster their agency and encourage other people  to participate. Recent research to explore the impact  of women’s representation in Cameroon’s parliament  found that their presence increases their participa - tion in decisionmaking structures and influences the  topics the parliament debates.101 Considering intergenerational relationships can  also point out mechanisms related to reparations,  reconciliation and transitional justice.102 Australia’s  parliament issued an official acknowledgment and  apology to the Stolen Generations103 and their fami - lies and a report outlining recommendations to sup - port reconciliation.104 The Community Arts Network  started a program to amplify the voices of indigenous  elders to tell their stories of oppression, suffering and  survival. The common elements in their narratives  were cycles of dispossession, consequences of dis - possession in their lives, and cultural continuity and  survival. Through spaces of representation the in - digenous elders gave voice to their history as part of  healing, and the wider community was asked to ac - knowledge the stories and legacy to understand the  land they inhabit.105 Participating in decisionmaking and building so - cial networks are key to strengthen representation  and agency. Inclusion is essential for devolving de - cisionmaking power to local contexts, through which  equal participation and cooperation at the communi - ty level can be achieved.106 In Kutna Hora, Czechia,  the government conducted participatory budgeting  with young people and children in 2019. Both prima - ry and high school students participated in the local  government’s budget allocation. Each class appoint - ed representatives to present a project on behalf of  their schools for the budget from the school level up  to the municipal level. Young people filled the role  of coordinators in the local rounds of budget allo - cations. In the final phase the budget allocation was  opened for all the students to vote. The initial idea  from the local government was for young people to experience democracy on their own as executers and  decisionmakers. In contrast with similar exercises,  this case was motivated by the objective of incorpo - rating young people.107 Collective action and social movements  shaping culture and coping with uncertainty Collective action, through social movements and  community-level initiatives, can be a source of inspi - ration for researchers, policymakers and advocates  (spotlights 6.6 and 6.7). To redress inequalities and provide equal oppor - tunities for people to expand their agency and foster  human development, transformation is imperative  at the level of social norms and culture. Social move - ments are key to achieving that. Where we go from here is our choice We must learn to live with uncertain times and unset - tled lives. This year’s Human Development Report  challenges us to aspire to more than mere accommo - dation. Unlocking our human potential will require  us to let flexibility, creativity, solidarity and inclusion  guide us to imagine and create futures in which we  thrive. Where we go from here is our choice. One of the  great lessons of our species’ history is that we can ac - complish a lot with very little if we work in solidarity  towards shared goals. Dangerous planetary change,  uncharted transitions and polarization are making  uncertainty more challenging. Even so, we have more  tools than ever to help navigate and course correct,  and no amount of technological wizardry is a substi - tute for good leadership, social cohesion or trust. If  we can start fixing the human side of the planetary  ledger—and this Report tries to highlight how—then  the future, however uncertain, will be more promise  than peril, just as it should be. CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION 191 Flexibility should be understood as rejecting one- size-fits-all policy solutions and deliberately prac - ticing iteration, variation and recombination in  policymaking. For instance, chapter 4 builds on the  need to upgrade strategies for human security such  as strengthening social protection systems with built- in adaptive capabilities. Practices such as feedback  loops, iterative learning and iterative design can be  valuable tools to navigate uncertain contexts and find  solutions that adapt best to different contexts and  moments. A key factor for creating knowledge and transmit - ting ideas is cumulative cultural evolution.1 Because  evolution does not necessarily mean efficiency and  equality of outcomes, it requires strategies to favour  flexibility, allowing adaptation to constantly chang - ing conditions. But efficiency and flexibility need not  be interchangeable in policy outcomes if flexibility is  based on dynamic mechanisms to enable change.2 In  fact, a balance of both can be superior in uncertain  contexts.3 Creativity would have a hard time thriving in ho - mogeneous and rigid contexts, and adequate con - text-aware solutions are hard to find through safe  repetition of a narrow set of policies. In chapter 3 suc - cessful policy reformers were characterized by their  willingness to try creative problem-solving strategies.  Uncertainty means we are always facing new and  multifaceted challenges. Solutions to these challeng - es can emerge only in environments with matching  dynamism. Chapter 5 points out how our ability to  thrive under uncertainty and achieve transformations  will depend on creative policy change. In practice,  creativity requires exploring tools and approaches  such as iterative learning, diverse perspectives and  risk management. Creativity depends on societies’  interconnectedness, the fidelity of the information  and learning transmitted, and cultural trait diversity.4 Solidarity should be understood as recognizing our  interconnectedness. “Solidarity does not assume that our struggles are the same struggles, or that our pain  is the same pain, or that our hope is for the same fu - ture. Solidarity involves commitment, and work, as  well as the recognition that even if we do not have  the same feelings, or the same lives, or the same bod - ies, we do live in common ground.”5 For example, re - distributive policies such as robust social protection  recognize how inequities in agency, freedoms and ca - pabilities have direct and indirect consequences for  all individuals, groups and societies.  Incorporating solidarity means acknowledging that  our lives are interconnected by the multidimensional  impacts of our choices and our shared physical, eco - nomic and social spaces. In the face of uncertainty,  people can turn to default values that go beyond stra - tegic thinking, and in an environment of trust, the de - fault can be solidarity (chapter 4). And transitions to  renewable energy can be done in solidarity with the  groups and places where the resources reside (chap - ter 1), while unsustainable arrangements could pre - vent the consolidation of human development gains  for everyone. Inclusion can enable transformations, as seen in  examples throughout the Report. Chapter 4 high - lights ensuring access and equity in communications  technology. Chapters 2 and 5 discuss regulating arti - ficial intelligence to address algorithmic bias and dis - crimination. Inclusiveness goes beyond increasing  participation and diversity; it requires shifts in insti - tutions’ norms and attitudes and the cooperation of  relevant stakeholders, society and policymakers to  address the roots of unequal treatment.6 These four motivating principles are nonexhaus - tive, but balancing them could help chart paths to  transformation. Driving transformation requires ac - knowledging the links and tensions between them.  These principles are not mutually exclusive. They  often coexist and enable each other. For instance,  inclusion can unlock innovation.7 Exposure to diver - sity (of people, practices and institutions)8 motivates SPOTLIGHT 6.1 Principles to be cultivated to navigate uncertainty 192 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 people to learn,9 and iterative learning is part of  innovation.10 Solidarity and inclusion11 are interdependent. Sol - idarity requires recognizing and incorporating the  diversity of individuals, groups, perspectives and  lived experiences that coexist. At the same time  greater inclusion contributes to solidarity by fight - ing divisiveness and inequalities. Social movements  can teach us a lot about solidarity in the search for  inclusion, leading the way to leave no one behind.  Institutions can support the transformations pushed  by social movements and community initiatives by  listening to the diverse voices of those whose rights  are being abridged, allocating resources and inform - ing their research agendas to complement collective  actions.12 Beyond the multiple intersections there also might  be some tensions between these motivating princi - ples. The paradox of diversity represents an example, as chapter 3 discusses.13 Cultural trait diversity has  perhaps the largest potential to empower creativity  because it increases the recombinatorial possibilities.  But it also increases coordination costs due to the  multitude of perspectives. To address this, the cul - tural evolution approach analyses how high cultural  trait diversity allows for an evolution of approaches  favouring the traits that best adapt to the current cir - cumstances,14 understanding that these traits might  fall out of favour if the circumstances change. This re - quires a high tolerance for diversity, but it also means  that there will be inequality of outcomes because  some approaches borne out of the recombination  might fail and be discarded. However, the success - ful ones will spread and benefit all.15 So, although it  is generally possible to align flexibility, creativity, sol - idarity and inclusion, there is not a straightforward  path for them to work together, and tensions might  mean compromises along the way.

Women have organized initiatives  that range from local saving clubs and cooperatives to  traditional craft and barter systems.1 For the Zamuk - phila Women’s Community Project, women in Upsh - er villages formed a vegetable-growing community,  growing 70 percent to sell on the roadsides and the  rest for self-consumption. The project received sup - port from a corporation that allocated a piece of irri - gated land adjacent to the village, while the women  provided fertilizer and seeds.2 Another project in South Africa—the Mansomani  initiative, led by Black women—mobilized communi - ty support to convert a piece of land into an irrigated  sugar cane field and liaise with a local sugar mill. This  helped secure a source of income for community pro - ducers. Key success factors were leadership, which  persisted for more than 20 years, and external sup - port. In this line, external agents, such as nongovern - mental organizations, or governments can support  initiatives sensitive to local needs and aspirations,  preserving the community’s agency.3 Through this project women used what was already in place—land  and irrigation—and invested in crop resources to have  more economic independence and be better pre - pared to face shocks. In 2012 a group of practitioners in Democratic Re - public of the Congo started the African Institute for  Integrated Responses to Violence Against Women  and HIVAIDS at the Panzi Hospital to research men - tal health in African contexts. The hospital partnered  with a local feminist organization to provide counsel - ling and training in Kiswahili. Capacity building of  medical staff along with individual and group coun - selling sessions using music and dance to facilitate  healing and livelihood therapy provided for land and  tools for women to restart farming or rebuild assets.4  Building women’s emotional and economic agen - cy translated into more inclusion in political spaces,  empowering the women to express solidarity by or - ganizing themselves to raise funds by selling local  products.5 Having the perspective of local women af - fected by the same structural inequalities facilitated  coordination and communication and opened a dif - ferent array of possible solutions. NOTES 1 Nel and Binns 2000. 2 Nel and Binns 2000. 3 Nel and Binns 2000.4 Allowing women who are experiencing distress, stigmatization and isola - tion to embody positive states of spiritual and social connection can help  them heal as they find feelings of connection and belonging in collective  voice, movement and creative self-expression (Horn 2020). 5 Horn 2020.SPOTLIGHT 6.2 How local communities confront  rapid environmental change 194 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 Volunteerism can be seen as collective insurance  rooted in solidarity that can prepare communities for  environmental shocks. In Sudan during seasons of  either high demand or drought, communities work  together through nafeer  (calls to mobilize), where  people help each other plant and harvest crops. The  military engages as well, protecting the harvests from  theft and reconstructing mosques and other buildings  damaged during conflict. Without trust, collabora - tion and communication to build a sense of solidari - ty, this activity could not be accomplished by just one  farmer. But when people come together, crops can be  harvested faster and more productively.1 Policy mechanisms that favour inclusion typically  remove barriers or discriminatory attitudes and be - haviours to ensure people’s participation in social,  economic, political and civic spheres.2 Equal partici - pation fosters agency and increases diversity through  opportunities and choice. Inclusion can work as in - surance. For example, including smallholder farmers  in the design, business models and decisionmaking  of digital platform providers would go a long way  towards enabling the full potential and benefits of  information and communications technology innova - tions in Africa.3 There is rising demand for inclusion  policies as women, indigenous peoples and migrants  continue to be excluded.4 Since 2017 the Colombian  government has provided a special permit to grant  Venezuelan immigrants permission to work. In gener - al, the programme has expanded access to the labour  market, but barriers such as recognition of creden - tials or access to financial markets persist, limiting  the opportunities for immigrant workers.5 As part of a set of flexible and inclusive assessment methods, the  Netherlands has been working with local migrant and  refugee organizations to offer proof of Dutch-equiva - lent credentials and facilitate the assessment and rec - ognition of Syrian nationals’ qualifications.6 Deliberation can serve as insurance for polariza - tion7 and is one of the keys to achieving recognition.8  Although a natural human capacity, deliberation re - quires intentional and concerted efforts: rules, to  prompt inclusive and civil deliberation; stories that  make sense, provide meaning and instil a collective  sense of commitment; leadership that engages citi - zens in a deliberative rhetoric; outcomes that matter  to people; and the possibility to pass on and learn the  skills to instil a culture of deliberation.9 Deliberation  is especially important for enabling public reason - ing in a participatory and inclusive way, where ideas  are represented and put forth by all groups irrespec - tive of their political, economic or other status (see  chapter 4). Even in the absence of organized deliber - ation, contact among groups has been shown to de - crease dehumanization across groups10 and reduce  hostility.11 However, negative contact can exacerbate  hostilities,12 pointing to the importance of setting  up deliberation and intergroup contact for success  through the conditions and settings in which they  are encouraged. Beyond deliberation, voting is effec - tive as well because it allows citizens to restrain de - fectors and reassures cooperative citizens that their  efforts are not futile. Accompanying cultural change  could consist of a shift in the mindset from exclusive - ly seeking self-interest to believing that people can  make decisions for the greater good.13 NOTES 1 Lough and others 2018. 2 Yang and others 2016. 3 Sarku 2022. 4 Yang and others 2016. 5 Selee and Bolter 2022. 6 Desiderio 2016. 7 Fishkin and others 2021.8 Fuentes-Nieva 2022. 9 Ryfe 2005. 10 Bruneau and others 2021. 11 Wojcieszak and Warner 2020. 12 Wojcieszak and Warner 2020. 13 Hauser and others 2014.SPOTLIGHT 6.3 How volunteerism, inclusion and  deliberation can work as insurance 195 CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION Mental distress can become an obstacle to human  development under certain circumstances (see chap - ter 2). To avoid this, policymakers as well as people  themselves can take action and prevent situations that  cause mental distress, mitigate crises and build psy - chological resilience without leaving anyone behind. Preventing distress The first layer of policies to tackle the cycle of distress  and constrained human development consists of pre - venting distress. Building safe environments through  strong national institutions and international cooper - ation is the ideal setting. Socioeconomic policymak - ing can contribute to this goal. Income support, for  instance, has been shown to significantly decrease  mental distress of children and young people living  in a household.1 Education is key to empowerment,  enabling people to filter good-quality information  out of abundant information during the digital age.  It can also encourage people to take action regarding  climate change and other anthropogenic pressures,  proving them with ownership and agency to shape  their own future.2 And it can prevent discrimination.3 Diplomacy and negotiation can prevent some vi - olent conflicts. But other conflicts can be stopped  from turning violent at a much earlier stage through  socially cohesive communities as well as tightly knit  support networks.4 Moreover, social embeddedness   — social connections and interpersonal relationships  within social networks and group identities  — has  been found to reduce stress and anxiety.5 In the face  of threat and uncertainty, cultural norms are crucial  to keep societies cohesive and organized.6 Mitigating crises As demonstrated by the Covid-19 pandemic, as well  as by multiple extreme weather events around the globe, crisis prevention may not always be possible in  the light of unprecedented threats. In that case socio - economic policies can provide transitionary continu - ity and stability. During multiple lockdowns caused  by the pandemic, economies with strong social con - tracts and robust social protection schemes caused  fewer worries to the people and were less affected by  economic consequences.7 Examples include univer - sal emergency payments comparable to a temporary  universal basic income8 and some traditional social  protection policies such as extended sickness bene - fits, unemployment protection and benefits for fam - ilies and older people.9 The pandemic has shown that  strong social institutions can help mitigate crises by  contributing to stability. But some of these measures  can also help during extreme weather events, when  droughts or floods impair harvests, or when liveli - hoods are damaged during armed conflicts. Relying  on tightly knit social protection schemes assures peo - ple’s livelihoods and can thus alleviate mental dis - tress until crises are overcome. Building resilience Not all uncertainties and crises can be prevented or  mitigated, but this does not mean that people have  to develop mental disorders. With universal access  to mental health services as well as other culturally  aligned resilience building and healing approaches,10  people are often able to absorb mental distress and  thrive in the context of uncertainties. Many of these  services could be offered within existing social struc - tures, such as schools and community centres. There is a wide variety of mental health and well - being interventions, but some have proven especial - ly effective for distress. For example, eye movement  desensitization and reprocessing has shown signifi - cant improvement of post-traumatic stress disorder  symptoms,11 including in veterans and children,12  exceeding the success of pharmacotherapy.13 Yoga SPOTLIGHT 6.4 Addressing mental distress:  Capabilities for people and policymakers 196 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 can alleviate anxiety, depression and somatization14  and release stress-related muscle tensions that can  cause migraines.15 Mindfulness exercises and med - itation have been used in psychotherapy for a long  time,16 and empirical evidence shows that they can  improve depression17 and aggressive behaviour.18  Accessible at large scale, this can break cycles of  violence and mental distress  — one step towards building peaceful societies. More attention needs to  be paid to providing universal access to these and  other techniques as well as to dismantling stigma - tization around mental health. Narratives within  the policy discourse can help achieve this and foster  hope collectively.19 Source: Human Development Report Office.

People  can now immediately find and share content with bil - lions of other users online through platforms such as  Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, Snapchat,  TikTok, Twitter, WhatsApp and YouTube, among  many others. Publicity, the arts, entertainment, com - merce, advocacy, education, journalism and even  public entities have adapted strategies to reach users  in online socialization spaces. The same applies to  the distribution of news. By 2021 close to 60 percent  of users in some world regions were using platforms  such as Facebook and WhatsApp to get their news  (figure S6.5.1).1  Along with the potential benefits of rapidly ex - panding virtual social spaces, social media provide  fertile ground for spreading misinformation2 and  fake news,3 and the targeted and intentional use of  platforms to enhance polarization and radicaliza - tion.4 Prominent social media platforms have been  called to action on this front by users, policymakers,  authorities and their own conviction.  The policy discussion on misinformation often  finds tension in the intersection between freedom of  expression and both the importance of accurate, veri - fied and trustworthy diffusion of information and the  determination of boundaries of respect and civility  in online behaviour. “We want to help people stay in - formed without stifling productive public discourse. There is also a fine line between false news and sat - ire or opinion.”5 “It’s not just what we take down, but  how we treat all the content we leave up that gives us  the best path forward. (…) An overly aggressive ap - proach towards removals would also have a chilling  effect on free speech.”6 Big social media platforms  now have policies and guidelines on misinformation  and have developed varying strategies to combat it,  ranging from user-initiated reporting features to re - moval of misinformation and restriction of accounts.  Governing bodies, national and international, have  shown more interest in the effects of media misinfor - mation. The UN Secretary-General’s Roadmap for  Digital Cooperation and the upcoming Global Dig - ital Compact in the context of the Common Agenda  incorporate prioritizing digital trust and security for  the present and future of digital development.7 Poli - cy recommendations on misinformation at the inter - national level highlight the importance of protecting  human rights and freedom of expression; emphasiz - ing methods that build trust, media literacy and co - operation; and emphasizing the dangers of overusing  and misusing censorship.8 The European Union has increased its regulation  on disinformation and the use of social media. The  European Commission developed an action plan  that includes a Code of Practice on Disinformation,  the European Digital Media Observatory and the Eu - ropean Democracy Action Plan, with guidelines for  Figure S6.5.1 A considerable portion of users across the world get their news from social media platforms 4591114162340 TelegramTikTokTwitterFB MessengerInstagramWhatsAppYouTubeFacebookEurope 2611131062534North America 99141118244243Asia 611161128353557Latin America 1814341529554459Africa Source: Newman and others 2022.SPOTLIGHT 6.5 Social media misinformation and freedom of expression 198 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 obligations and accountability of online platforms.9  The Digital Services Act, a “comprehensive set of  new rules regulating the responsibilities of digital ser - vices that act as intermediaries within the EU to con - nect consumers with goods, services and content,”10 was agreed in April 2022 and will reshape the obliga - tions and relationships between digital services and  governance structures in Europe.

This can translate  into collective organization and action in search of  community resilience and better development out - comes. Social movements are a clear example of how  people’s choices have supported transformations.  Throughout history the world has witnessed the  power of social movements, where people connected  by a shared purpose or common identity have trig - gered transformational change for entire societies.3  A wide range of social movements develop because  of unmet expectations and moral beliefs of fairness  and social justice.4 Some do so through collective  identity.5 In all cases the process is linked to emotions  and cultural ideas with the power to transform a per - sonal goal or interest, to adopt the goals and interests  of a group.6 Individuals involving themselves in a so - cial movement develop a shared normative perspec - tive or shared concerns for change that give them a  sense of common purpose.7 Individuals join social movements and sustain  their mobilization because of rational, emotional, be - havioural, leadership, organizational and social-nor - mative factors.8 Even though emotions are present  in every phase of the lifecycle of a social movement9  and they positively motivate individuals, they have  often been dismissed or unjustly judged by outsid - ers.10 For instance, protestors are often portrayed as  irrational or immature,11 hostile or violent, or as need - ing to be disciplined.12 The study of emotions in pol - itics and social movements emerged to recognize  that emotions permeate any political action,13 shape  movements’ goals and determine their success. This analysis can provide insights to necessary changes for  transformation by encouraging new ways of thinking  and approaching policy mechanisms.  For a social movement to succeed, one of the  most important factors is for it to lead towards so - cial change and transformation as well as strategic  choices.14 Social movements can emerge when a large  group of people become distressed by a particular  situation or driven by leaders who mobilize people  and facilitate broader awareness of concerns, then  coalesce when they become more organized to raise  awareness and mobilize resources. After formal and  informal institutions take notice of a movement and  bureaucratize it, a social movement can follow sever - al paths before starting to decline (figure S6.6.1).15 Successful social movements have demonstrated  a commitment to changing norms and attitudes, not  just policy reforms. For instance, LGBTQI+ advo - cates used polling research to reframe public cam - paign messages on rights to include wording on love  and commitment as well; this eventually turned into  the “Love is love” slogan and contributed to change  in marriage laws.16 The frequency of social protests increased by an av - erage of 11.5 percent a year between 2009 and 2019  across all regions of the world, with the largest con - centration of activity in the Middle East and North  Africa and the fastest growth in Sub-Saharan Africa.17  The Covid-19 pandemic halted mass protests from  March to May 2020, but rather than disappearing, so - cial movements adapted to the pandemic measures  and bounced back as restrictions eased.18  Identity social movements arise to challenge tra - ditional understandings of power distribution and  reframe how certain groups are perceived. These  movements aim to reclaim and transform narratives  around identity for a group that has been historical - ly discriminated against and oppressed. Confront - ing traditional beliefs and behaviours constitutes  a reclaim of power and provides a sense of agency, SPOTLIGHT 6.6 Collective action and social movements   shaping culture and coping with uncertainty 200 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 pride, self-confidence and equality.19 This type of  movement is both reformative and transformative,  as it looks to expand opportunities but also freedoms.  Take the example of the feminist movement (spot - light 6.7). Although powerful in their transformative capacity  and as examples of in-group solidarity, identity-based  struggles may also reify adversarial narratives be - tween groups and reaffirm structural and social divi - sions based on certain identity dimensions. This can  bring about challenges in broader global cooperation  and can lead to violence and conflict. It can also over - shadow the freedom that exists within self-identifica - tion and the overlapping multidimensional identities  across the world. This is especially concerning for  movements that seek to encroach on the freedoms  of others. As argued in chapter 3, key to address - ing these challenges is recognizing that each person  comprises multiple, overlapping identities that can  acquire different salience depending on context and  can change over time. Social movements’ enduring impacts permeate  cultural repertoires and transform societies. They  can change the way we live, make us question tra - ditional beliefs, reposition identities and eliminate stereotypes and prejudices. The policy changes that  have emerged from protests and movements have de - pended on broad changes in public attitudes.20 Mobi - lizations change culture through different channels:  public opinion, memories, language and lifestyle, the  media, and political and nonpolitical institutions.21  They are a way to give momentum and directionali - ty to the feedback cycle between social attitudes and  norms and institutional and policy responses. The nature and tone of media coverage can shift  public opinion perceptions, even if indirectly. A study  documenting public opinion change as an outcome  of the feminist movement in the United States ar - gues that the media coverage had a significant effect  on gender attitudes, such that the public started re - considering traditional roles and adopting alterna - tive views.22 Although traditional news outlets still  dominate news gathering in Europe and the United  States23 and have a strong influence over politics, so - cial media has impacted these dynamics significant - ly in recent years as the circulation of news stories is  increasingly featured on platforms such as Facebook,  Instagram, TikTok, Twitter and YouTube. Through  media and social media, activists have defied tra - ditional portrayals of groups, combated stigma and Figure S6.6.1 Social movements connect collective action with institutions Emerge Bureaucratize DeclineRaise awareness  and mobilize resources Success Failure Repression MainstreamingCo-optation Coalesce Link to media  and institutions Source: Human Development Report Office elaboration adapted from Blumer (1995), Mauss (1975) and Tilly (1977). 201 CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION increased the representation of groups among writ - ers, producers and performers.24 More decentralized  and open access to media has increased the rep - resentation and diversity of perspectives on a plat - form. But it has also raised concerns about the quality  of information and the need for tools to filter, discern  and manage violence, hate and misinformation. In  these contexts there is a risk for some forms of social  movements to spread misinformation and promote  forms of injustice, domination and oppression.  Changes in day-to-day behaviours, such as life - style or language, are other channels for movements  to trigger change. The changes in the law for same- sex marriage has triggered rapid shifts in attitudes.  Combined with the activism of LGBTQI+ rights  movement, the changes have combatted stigma, re - framed gender as a social construct and incorporat - ed inclusive language and gender-neutral pronouns  for nonbinary and queer people.25 However, in some  countries where third-gender categories have been  officially recognized for decades, many LGBTQI+  activists are campaigning against the forceful impo - sition of third-gender pronouns, highlighting the im - portance of people having the agency to determine  their own identity rather than having it imposed  on them by outside actors.26 Thanks to the feminist  movement the terms machismo or male chauvinist,  feminist and sexist have become more widely used  and understood.27Other movements such as those linked to environ - mentalism and social justice have produced lifestyle  changes in societies where they are most promi - nent.28 People modify their behaviour to be coherent  across their ideologies, values and actions. Exam - ples of changes in daily behaviours include boycott - ing firms that do not comply with raised standards  for sustainable behaviour. These conscious consum - ers are more likely to become politically active29 and  can present incentives for businesses to increasing - ly declare and act on their social and environmental  principles with more inclusive and sustainable prac - tices.30 Local communities are transforming practic - es for sustainable food systems as well. Indigenous  communities have learned how to live off the earth  without damaging the integrity of ecosystems. Māori  and Quechua communities have built a platform to  reclaim cultural rights over food landscapes by pro - moting collective rights and responsibilities over land  and food, based on their community practices to pre - serve agrobiodiversity.31 When individuals belonging to a community per - ceive that government institutions or authorities are  unreliable and unsupportive, policies and regula - tion might seem insufficient. This creates a need for  action, and collaboration is used as a coping mech - anism.32 In these contexts social movements are  rooted in solidarity, key for overcoming injustice,  domination and oppression.33 NOTES 1 Around the 1980s efforts from social movements to transform dominant  cultural behaviours and identities began to be recognized (Goodwin and  Jasper 2006; Johnston, Larana and Gusfield 1994).  2 Fransen and others 2021. 3 Zald, Morrill and Rao 2005. 4 Jenkins, Wallace and Fullerton 2008. 5 Polletta and Jasper 2001. 6 Social movements have questioned the status quo—policies, institutions  and structures—and have shed light on human rights violations, discrimi - nation and violence (Blumer 1951; Christiansen 2009). 7 DeFronzo and Gill 2020; James and Van Seters 2014. 8 Bate, Bevan and Robert 2004. 9 Jasper 2011. 10 Ferree 1992; Flam 1990. 11 Goodwin, Jasper and Polletta 2000. 12 Jasper 2021. 13 Goodwin and Jasper 2006.14 Crutchfield 2018.

CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION 203 Women’s and feminist movements have advanced  women’s rights across a variety of issues, both nation - ally and globally. Feminist mobilizations are associat - ed with better legal rights to participate in economic  life, greater representation in politics, better support  for paid and unpaid domestic care work, better pro - tection from sexual harassment, better access to land  tenure, financial inclusion,1 overcoming stigma and  raising awareness around violence against women  and girls.2 Feminist mobilizations have grown across  every Human Development Index (HDI) group. Low  and medium HDI countries have seen the great - est increases in autonomy and strength of feminist  movements ( figure S6.7 .1). Low HDI countries that  have seen a greater increase in feminist movements include Burkina Faso, Haiti, Liberia, Rwanda, Sen - egal and Uganda. Among medium HDI countries,  Bangladesh, Cameroon, India and Morocco, among  others, have. South Asia and Latin America have had  the highest Feminist Mobilization Index scores on av - erage since 1995, while the Arab States have had the  lowest. Feminist mobilizations defy stereotypes, redefine  boundaries and expand agency for women and girls.  They can open pathways to enhanced wellbeing and  agency for women occupying spaces in all spheres  of life, using their voices to bring new perspectives,  participate equally in society and hold governments  and others in positions of power accountable. Coun - tries with powerful feminist movements or higher  women’s representation in parliaments adopted an  average of five more gender-sensitive measures in  response to the Covid-19 pandemic than countries  without these features.3 Activists in these countries  developed feminist plans and gender budget assess - ments in addition to demanding action to address  violence against women and girls and to improve ac - cess to public services. Two examples are the Gender  and Covid-19 Roundtable with 79 civil society organ - izations in Chile4 and the Women’s Caucus in Brazil’s  legislature5 (Bancada Feminina) advocating for facil - ities that aid women and girls who are subject to vio - lence to be declared essential public services.  Women’s participation in social movements has  promoted changes in traditional gender norms  through two main pathways: policy reforms and re - framing gender roles and power relations.6 Coun - tries with a lower presence of women’s movements  or protests (as measured by the Feminist Mobiliza - tion Index) have the highest biases against gender  equality and women’s empowerment (as measured  by the Gender Social Norms Index; figure S6.7 .2;  see also box S6.7 .1).

A country without a feminist movement at all is scored  a 0 (FMI = 0 + [0*0] = 0). The index awards 1 point for the existence of a move - ment, so a country with a feminist movement of some variety that is either not  strong or not autonomous is scored a 1 (1 + [1*0] or 1 + [0*1]). A country with a  strong and autonomous feminist movement is scored a 2 (1 + [1*1]). The coun - tries with the strongest autonomous movements are scored a 3 (1 + [2*1] = 3).

The asso - ciation between the presence of biases and lower  feminist mobilization appears in political and eco - nomic dimensions: in countries with lower feminist  mobilizations, almost 50 percent of people think men  make better political leaders and more than 40 per - cent think they make better business executives than  women. How are biases against gender equality  and women’s empowerment changing?  The 2022 Gender Social Norms Index Gender inequalities persist, and recent shocks, in - cluding planetary imbalances, the Covid-19 pan - demic and economic crises, are aggravating the  current scenario for women all over the world. The  Gender Inequality Index (GII) reveals a lack of glob - al improvement in its dimensions, with the world  value stagnating at 0.465 for the past three years.  Alarmingly, all regions experienced a decline in GII  value from 2019 to 2020 except South Asia, which experienced an increase; from 2020 to 2021 all re - gions except the Arab States and East Asia and the  Pacific registered a decline.7 While women have seen  some progress in basic capabilities, there are still  challenges in areas that involve greater agency and  power. In 59 countries adult women are more edu - cated than adult men. In those same countries the  income gender gap is 39 percent.8 Behind these cal - culations social norms help us understand these dy - namics of power imbalances.  According to the Gender Social Norms Index,  91 percent of men and 88 percent of women show  at least one clear bias against gender equality in  areas such as politics, economics, education, inti - mate partner violence and women’s reproductive  rights (figure S6.7 .3; see also box S6.7 .1). Men have  high biases in thinking that men make better polit - ical leaders than women do (52.8 percent) and that  men should have more right to a job than women  (50.2 percent). Women present fewer biases across  all dimensions.  This year’s Gender Social Norms Index results pro - vide hope, showing an improvement from the first Figure S6.7.2 Countries with less feminist movements have higher biases against gender equality and women’s  empowerment Percent of people biased Feminist Mobilization Index valueGender Social Norms Index Believe me n make better political leaders than women do Believe me n make better business executives than women do 90.187.6 84.0 73.8 50.6 45.4 41.7 31.444.1 38.8 37.8 28.7 0102030405060708090100 0 1 2 3 Source: UNDP 2020b; Forester and others 2022. 205 CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION time it was calculated. On average, biases against  gender equality and women’s empowerment de - clined from 2010–2014 to 2017–2022 (table S6.7 .1).  Most countries and territories with time-series data  showed progress: women in 23 countries and territo - ries and men in 26 countries and territories showed  reduced biases against gender equality and women’s  empowerment (figure S6.7 .4). Progress in the share  of people with no bias was greater in Germany, New  Zealand, Singapore and Japan. But there were rever - sals in several countries, among women in 14 coun - tries and men in 11 countries. The greatest reversals  took place in the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Chile  and Iraq.Expanding human development and drawing  cultural change in a patriarchal society  In line with the two-tier framework presented in  chapter 6, the different policy blocks can support  the task of defying gender social norms. Investing  in gender-sensitive responses to shocks, especially  initiatives that build partnerships between govern - ments and civil society,9 can help women better cope  with uncertainty. Strengthening and expanding so - cial protection systems to cover women can work as  insurance, increasing their bargaining power at the  household level, promoting financial inclusion, sup - porting long-term income generation and building Box S6.7.1 The Gender Social Norms Index—measuring biases, prejudices and beliefs The Gender Social Norms Index, introduced in the 2019 Human Development Report, comprises four dimensions— political, educational, economic and physical integrity. It is constructed based on responses to seven questions from  the World Values Survey, which are used to create seven indicators (box figure 1).

Source:  Mukhopadhyay, Rivera and Tapia 2019.  For each indicator a variable takes the value of 1 when an individual has a bias and 0 when the individual does not.  The core index value is an aggregation based on the “union approach,” which measures the percentage of people  with biases, independent of the number of biases. In many instances it might take only one bias from one person to  block a woman’s progress in society.  This year’s index covers two sets of countries and territories. The first set consists of countries and territories with  data for wave 5 (2005–2009), wave 6 (2010–2014) or wave 7 (2017–2022) of the World Values Survey (accessed  April 2022) and uses the latest data available. This set includes 76 countries and territories, accounting for more than  84 percent of the global population. The second set consists of only countries and territories with data for wave 6 and  wave 7. This set includes 37 countries and territories, accounting for 48 percent of the global population.

The second tier that targets cultural mismatch - es can go a long way in shifting gender traditional  norms—for example, through gender transformative  education.11 This approach uses the whole education  system (policies, pedagogies and community engage - ment) to transform stereotypes, attitudes and prac - tices regarding power relations and gender binaries  by raising critical consciousness about the root cause  of inequalities. Increasing women’s representation  in public spaces, institutions, governance processes  and leadership positions can change stereotypes and  support changes in laws and policies defending wom - en’s rights. Recognizing the relevance of shifting so - cial norms for gender equality or of women’s right to  body and physical integrity can help change scripts  and narratives to portray women in a certain way and  to build hope.  Feminist movements and women’s different forms  of resistance and action have come a long way, so  amid uncertainty, we can imagine and build a fem - inist future.

As Wagner- Pacifici (2017, p. 1) argues: “Historical events  provoke an enormous sense of uncertainty.  The world seems out of whack, and everyday  routines are, at the least, disrupted. People  often experience a vertiginous sensation that  a new reality or era may be in the making, but  it is one that does not yet have a clear shape  and trajectory, or determined consequences.  [Events imply a] complex dynamic of ‘unknow - ing’ and then reknowing a world transformed  by events.” With relevance to the layer of  uncertainty associated with the Anthropo - cene emphasized in the Report, the author  continues: “[P]lanetary environmental crisis is  an event in which the ground becomes  the  event.” (Wagner-Pacifici 2017, p. 165). 2 UN 2022c, 2022d. 3 UN Global Crisis Response Group on Food  2022. 4 FAO and others 2021. 5 UNDP 2022b. 6 Satake 2014. 7 Toor and others (2021) estimate that the vac - cines covered in their study averted 50 mil - lion deaths from 2000 to 2019.

We are grateful to Toby Ord for  contributing text to this paragraph. 23 These two layers of uncertainty echo the  framing emanating from assessments of the  implications of climate change for financial  stability (see, for instance, BIS 2021), which  distinguishes between two sources of risk  when it comes to valuing assets: physical  risks and transition risks. Physical risks are  associated with how hazards exacerbated by  climate change can lower asset values—for  instance, how floods can lower the value of  houses located near the sea or in flood-prone  areas. Transition risks are associated with  changes in regulation or consumer tastes that  can result in stranded assets—for instance,  if coal-fired power plants are forbidden or  rejected by consumers, the value of coal min - ing and coal-fired power plants can collapse.  Chapter 1 extends this framework by looking  beyond physical risks of climate change to  consider the broader set of challenges asso - ciated with the Anthropocene context and by  looking beyond the climate transition to con - sider the broader set of elements associated  with a transition to ease planetary pressures. 24 Pinto and others 2022. 25 See the discussion in chapter 2 of Black and  others (2022). 26 Diamond 2015; Hyde 2020.  27 Boese and others 2022. 28 Østby, Aas Rustad and Arasmith 2021; UNDP  2022b . 29 UNHCR 2022c. 30 Hinrichs 2021; ILO 2018a.  31 See UNDP (2019). 32 Bollen and others 2021. 33 For example, Ahir, Bloom and Furceri (2022)  constructed a World Uncertainty Index based  on text analysis of Economist Intelligence Unit  reports.

PART I CHAPTER 1 1 At the start of 2022, UN Secretary-General  António Guterres warned world leaders of  increasing divergence between countries,  prompting a “recipe for instability” (UN 2022a),  echoing the need to strengthen multilateral - ism to meet humanity’s greatest challenges,  which was set out in the Secretary-General’s  report Our Common Agenda  (UN 2021c).  2 For example, the Covid-19 pandemic forced  an unprecedented human development  reversal, with decreases in life expectancy  at birth for two consecutive years (UNDP  2022b). Some 1.3 billion people live in multi - dimensional poverty, as of 2021 (UNDP and  OPHI 2020). And inequalities across groups  and in important aspects of human develop - ment are on the rise (UNDP 2019). 3 Uncertainty has been defined as the topic  of the decade by International Monetary  Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva  2020): “If I had to identify a theme at the out - set of the new decade, it would be increasing  uncertainty.” A time of shifting geopolitics,  increasing instability and global tensions has  also been identified by United Nations Secu - rity Council (2021). 4 UNDP 2022b.

In economics there is  a long tradition of thinking about uncertainty,  as in the contributions by Keynes (1909) and  Knight (1921). Today, the economics literature  on choice under uncertainty distinguishes  between choice under risk (when there is a  probability distribution associated with a set  of possible events) and choice under ambigu - ity (when the set of possible events is known  but the probability distribution is unknown).  Choices on climate change mitigation are  typically analysed as choices under risk, giv - en that a set of possible outcomes is known  and there are different ways of estimating the probability distributions associated with  them (even though there are disagreements  over what the probability distribution is). In  this context climate change is a source, or  driver, of uncertainty, not because we do not  know that something bad might happen and  not even because we cannot estimate how  likely it is for that to happen, but because  future outcomes are not certain but rather are  defined today in probabilistic terms. Crucially,  our own actions can (still) shape the direction  of our climate, which makes future outcomes  contingent on our choices, among other  things. Probabilities associated with uncertain  events can be estimated in different ways. For  recurrent events frequency of past events is  a common approach, including in the insur - ance industry. For rare or unprecedented  future events models or expert elicitation can  suggest distributions associated with future  events. When no probability distribution can  be derived for future events that can be  specified, we confront choice under ambigu - ity. And, of course, there is also the possibility  of confronting an event that has never been  imagined. All these possibilities fall under the  broad umbrella of uncertainty in this Report. 6 These two layers of uncertainty echo the  framing emanating from assessments of the  implications of climate change for financial  stability (see, for instance, BIS 2021), which  distinguish between two sources of risk when  it comes to valuation of assets: physical risks  and transition risks. Physical risks are as - sociated with how hazards exacerbated by  climate change can lower asset values—for  instance, how floods can lower the value of  houses located near the sea or in flood-prone  areas. Transition risks are associated with  changes in regulation or consumer tastes that  can result in stranded assets—for instance, if  coal-fired power plants are either forbidden  or rejected by consumers, the value of coal  mining and coal-fired power plants can col - lapse. This chapter extends this framework  by looking beyond physical risks of climate  change to consider the broader set of chal - lenges associated with the Anthropocene  context, as well as looking beyond the cli - mate transition to consider the broader set of  elements associated with a transition to ease  planetary pressures. 7 Pinto and others 2022. 8 Delgado 2022. 9 See figure 2.10 in UNDP (2020a).  10 Ellis 2022, p. 15. 11 Bollen and others 2021. 12 Bollen and others 2021; Ahir, Bloom and Furc - eri 2018. 13 The analysis predates the Covid-19 pandemic  and as such would not reflect any effects of  the pandemic. 14 Dodds and others 2015. 15 Martins and Baumard 2020. 16 Fan and others 2019; Helliwell and others  2022; Maurer and Holbach 2016. 17 Helliwell and others 2022; Jaidka and others  2020.18 For example, Ahir, Bloom and Furceri (2022)  constructed a World Uncertainty Index based  on text analysis of Economist Intelligence Unit  reports. They found that concerns about un - certainty have been steadily increasing since  2012, with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic  prompting a historical peak of the index. 19 Ayers and others 2020; Fetzer and others  2021.

For example, a recent  study found that a majority of people in 17 ad - vanced economies believe that the children  growing up today will be financially worse  off than their parents (Pew Research Center  2021). Yet other studies point towards young  people holding more optimistic views of their  future and the future of the world, at least  prior to the Covid-19 pandemic (Ipsos and Bill  & Melinda Gates Foundation 2018), particu - larly those in developing countries (UNICEF  2021a).  25 Choi and others 2022. 26 The Gallup Organization 2022. 27 Psychology research shows that while uncer - tainty in controlled situations—such as gam - bling—may be exciting, uncertainty is also  a major cause of stress, especially among  those with low tolerance of uncertainty or  when linked to situations in which we can - not rely on previous experience to inform  decisionmaking (Grupe and Nitschke 2013;  Harvard Medical School 2020; Tanovic, Gee  and Joormann 2018). 28 Pinto and others 2022; UNDP 2022b. 29 UNDP 2019. 30 World Bank 2020a. 31 UNDP and OPHI 2020. 32 Roser 2021. 33 Fleurbaey 2018, p. 42. 34 IPCC 2021, 2022b. 35 Malhi 2017. 36 The final adoption of a new epoch by the  stratigraphic community remains under con - sideration (Voosen 2022a). The proposal was  formally put forward by a working group set  up to consider the evidence in favour of a  new geological epoch (Zalasiewicz and oth - ers 2017). Recently, a suggestion was made to  characterize the Anthropocene as an unfold - ing geological event, rather than a geological  epoch with clear markers (Bauer and others  2021). See the 2020 Human Development  216 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 Report (UNDP 2020a) for a review of the  evidence, as well as the debate from multiple  perspectives from the natural sciences, social  sciences and humanities that the Anthropo - cene frame has motivated. 37 UNDP 2020a. 38 The argument that having power over some - thing creates an obligation to act (either  towards improving an outcome or stop some - thing that is harmful) has a long tradition in  ethical reasoning. For instance, it was invoked  by Buddha as the argument for why humans  should not harm nonhuman life. This example  and argument draw from Sen (2009b). 39 Ellis 2021; Ellis and others 2021. 40 Marra and others 2021. 41 Reyers 2017. 42 Polasky and others 2020. See also Lenton  (2019) and Lovejoy (2019). 43 The latest IPCC report shows that it is virtu - ally impossible that the acceleration of global  warming since 1970 has a geological cause.  Without stark action, human-induced emis - sions are expected to increase average tem - peratures by 1.5°C within the next 20 years,  with potential catastrophic consequences for  humans (IPCC 2021). 44 IPCC 2021. 45 Elhacham and others 2020. 46 IPBES 2019b; Pörtner and others 2021. 47 IPCC 2022b. 48 Carlson and others 2022.  49 Carlson and others 2022. 50 Marani and others 2021. 51 Rohr and others 2019. 52 WHO 2021g. 53 Kotz, Wenz and Levermann 2021. 54 CUNY Advanced Science Research Center  2021; see also Vörösmärty and others 2020. 55 Kotz and others 2021, p. 319. 56 Guo and others 2016. 57 Kotz, Wenz and Levermann 2021. 58 Guo and others 2016. 59 Kotz and others 2021. 60 Keys and others 2019. 61 Climate simulations are susceptible to an  inherent model uncertainty—across and  within models (Barnett, Brock and Hansen  2020). Some major sources of uncertainty  are derived from the evolution of greenhouse  gas emissions—which will be influenced by  human choices and policies—and the feed - back loops between different ecosystem  processes (Hausfather and others 2022). For  example, implementing a carbon tax will im - pact the cost of carbon, influence consump - tion and production choices and ultimately  affect emissions. But the optimal rate of such  a tax is difficult to identify, due to uncertainty  about the true social cost of carbon (Bar - nett, Brock and Hansen 2020) and whether people will accept such a tax (see, for ex - ample, the “yellow vest” fuel tax protests in  France). Thus, the assumptions made when  projecting future temperatures may lead to  vastly different conclusions (Hausfather and  others 2022), and researchers have been  raising a warning flag for a new generation of  “hot models” that overestimate temperature  increases (Voosen 2022b). Averaging projec - tions from different models is one way to deal  with model uncertainty, but too-hot models  may exaggerate the impact of emissions on  warming. The latest IPCC report instead mod - elled results based on different degrees of  warming, again illustrating the wide range of  possible outcomes. Inherent uncertainty in cli - mate models does not mean that warming is  not happening; indeed, the latest IPCC report  shows that average temperatures on Earth  are now 1°C higher than before the Industrial  Revolution, which without reasonable doubt is  due to human-induced emissions (IPCC 2021).  How emissions will evolve going forward, and  what their impact will be on temperatures and  the planet, is largely up to us.  62 See for example, the latest IPCC report, which  integrates cross-disciplinary insights into the  assessments of climate change risks. Based  on an understanding of the interdependent  adaptation of human societies and ecosys - tems, the report shows that—in the context of  climate change—human responses to climate  change add new layers of opportunity and  risk (IPCC 2022b).  63 Dosio and others 2018. 64 History can provide important insights.  Sometimes history is invoked to provide  cautionary tales for today’s world based on  narratives of ecocides in the past, in which  “civilizational collapse” was the outcome of  overusing natural resources. A popular read - ing of this narrative was based on Diamond  (2005). Recognizing that “[t]he chief practical  use of history is to deliver us from plausible  historical analogies” (James Bryce, cited in  Müller 2002, p. 5), a more recent account of  the historical record, made possible in part by  advances in technologies ranging from Earth  observation to the analysis of DNA deep into  the past, suggests that this account has been  oversimplified. 65 Degroot 2019; Degroot and others 2021. 66 Xu and others 2020. 67 UNDP 2020a. 68 UNDP 2022b. 69 Chancel and others 2022. 70 See table 6.6 in Chancel and others (2022). 71 Chancel and others 2022. 72 Chancel and others 2022. 73 Jafino and others 2020. 74 For example, pollution is a major health  threat, causing one in six deaths every year.  Over time, there has been a decrease in  poverty-related pollution-related deaths, such  as death due to polluted drinking water, but  deaths due pollution from industrialization,  such as toxic chemicals, have increased by more than 60 percent since the start of the  21st century, indicating that new gaps in pollu - tion inequality are opening (Fuller and others  2022). 75 Wing and others 2022. 76 Osman-Elasha n.d. 77 Some have even argued that the unequal  dynamics of climate change are reason for  “limitarianism” in income and wealth (Robeyns  2019). 78 Frank 2020. 79 Appadurai 2004. 80 La Ferrara 2019; Fruttero, Muller and Calvo- González 2021. 81 Conradie and Robeyns 2013. 82 Frank 2020. 83 Genicot and Ray 2017, 2020. 84 Greenaway, Frye and Cruwys 2015. 85 Lybbert and Wydick 2018. 86 Ord 2020.

In an adverse scenario,  where changes are too late and too sudden,  transitional uncertainties will be amplified,  transcending through different parts of our  economy and society (Gros and others 2016). 98 UNDP 2020a. 99 One way of taking an integrated perspective  on the multiple transitions to ease planetary  pressures and incorporating the role of tech - nological change is to draw on the approach  of the 2020 Human Development Report  (UNDP 2020a). Every form of life uses energy  and materials and sends them back to nature,  but the footprint of humans far exceeds that of  any other species. For most of human history,  the use of energy and materials was not too  far from the limits of their biological metabo - lism; it was not until the Industrial Revolution  that humans began to capture and use energy  and materials at a scale comparable to the  biosphere. Sociometabolic research provides  NOTES 217 deeper insights into how society interacts with  nature and studies biophysical flows across  them and how such a relationship evolves  over time (Haberl and others 2011). Bringing  the disciplines of economics and sociology  together with earth and natural sciences, it ex - plores how matter and energy change forms  as they are extracted and used by societies. In  human history major advances in technology  followed transitions to higher energy inputs  and altered material cycles, leading to new so - cial and environmental orders. In many cases  the step increases in energy resulted in more  waste products disrupting the environment,  initially on a local scale and now at the plan - etary scale (Lenton, Pichler and Weisz 2016). 100 UNDP 2020a. 101 Smil 2022. 102 Smil 2022. 103 Bai and others 2016. 104 Cai 2020. 105 Balta-Ozkan, Watson and Mocca 2015; Gamb - hir, Green and Pearson 2018. 106 ILO 2018b. 107 Bergant, Mano and Shibata 2022. 108 Bolton, Adrian and Kleinnijenhuis 2022. 109 Lieu and others 2020. 110 Haberl and others 2011; Krausmann and oth - ers 2008; UNDP 2020a.  111 The global weighted-average levelized cost  of utility-scale solar photovoltaics fell by 85  percent between 2010 and 2020; during the  same period the global weighted-average  cost of electricity from onshore wind projects  fell by 56 percent (IRENA 2021). 112 IEA 2021c. 113 BP 2020. 114 Graham-Rowe 2011. 115 Rulli and others 2016. 116 Jeswani, Chilvers and Azapagic 2020. 117 Verdade, Piña and Rosalino 2015. 118 Webb and Coates 2012. 119 Oehlschlaeger, Wang and Sexton 2013. 120 Hertel 2009. 121 Sepulveda and others 2021. 122 Bolton and others 2020; NGFS 2019. 123 Campiglio and others 2018. 124 The White House 2022.  125 NGFS 2021. 126 Erlanger and Sengupta 2021.  127 Peszko and others 2020. 128 Engebretsen and Anderson 2020. 129 Smith and Brower 2022. 130 Alderman 2021. 131 The renewable energy sector currently em - ploys 12 million people worldwide, with the  sector expected to grow to provide 114 million  jobs, assuming current policies and pledges are successfully executed.

Both agriculture and  mining, human activities that exert pressures  on the planet, have been linked to serious hu - man rights issues in low- and middle-income  countries. For example, almost 70 percent of  all child labour and almost 30 percent of peo - ple in modern slavery are found in agriculture.  Hazardous work conditions, child labour and  other violations are linked to artisanal mining  of various metals (Sellare and others 2022). 143 Sonter and others 2020.  144 Rehbein and others 2020. 145 These estimates vary considerably across  studies depending on model assumptions  of anticipated policies, types of technologies  and timeframe, among others; however, even  under an ambitious assumption of reuse and  recycle, the rate of mining will have to in - crease multifold (Hund and others 2020; IEA  2021b; Sovacool and others 2020). 146 Heffernan 2019. 147 Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel  2021. 148 Race 2019. 149 UNDP 2020a. 150 WWF Australia 2021. 151 Hataway 2017. 152 Circle Economy 2020.  153 MaterialFlows 2022. 154 Bringezu and others 2017; OECD 2019a. 155 Circle Economy 2020; Veidis and others  2022.  156 Elhacham and others 2020. 157 OECD 2020a. 158 IAEA 2018. 159 Schlesinger and Bernhardt 2013. 160 Kinzig and Socolow 1994. 161 Eutrophication happens when the mineral  and nutrient levels in a body of water increase  excessively.

In this approach  risk is seen as a failure to fulfil the central  elements of the reference narrative. Resolv - able uncertainty is uncertainty that can be  resolved by looking something up or that can  be represented by a known probability distri - bution of outcomes. With radical uncertainty,  however, there is no similar means of resolv - ing the uncertainty—we simply do not know. 170 WEF 2020a. 171 Studley 2021. 172 Business of Apps 2022. 173 Hilbert 2022. 174 Jacob and Akpan 2015. 175 Mirchandani 2018; Mutahi and Kimari 2017. 176 Midgley and others 2021.  177 Neophytou, Manwell and Eikelboom 2021. 178 Brady and others 2017. 179 Messing and Weisel 2017.  180 Immordino-Yang, Christodoulou and Singh  2012. 181 Levy 2021. 182 Mitchell, Gottfried and Matsa 2015. 183 Kreps 2020. 184 Nowotny 2021. 185 OpenAI and Pilipiszyn 2022. 186 Imperva 2016. 187 Vosoughi, Roy and Aral 2018. 188 O’Neil 2016. 189 Ciancaglini and others 2020. 190 Hill 2020. 191 de Ágreda 2020. 192 Acemoglu 2021. 193 Meenakshi 2022. 194 Meenakshi 2022. 195 Prabhune 2022. 196 Cyranoski and Ledford 2018. 197 Mehravar and others 2019. 198 Lanphier and others 2015. 199 Waltz 2022. 200 Waltz and Nature Biotechnology 2021. 201 Aslam and others 2022. 202 Selfa, Lindberg and Bain 2021. 203 Stiglitz and Guzman 2021. 218 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 204 Polasky and others 2020. 205 Kay and King 2020. 206 Klein and Kruglanski 2013; van Baar, Halpern  and FeldmanHall 2021. 207 Funke, Schularick and Trebesch 2016. 208 Boese and others 2022. 209 Boese and others 2022. 210 Boese and others 2022; International IDEA  2021; Repucci and Slipowitz 2022. 211 Stiglitz and Guzman 2021. 212 Druckman 2017. 213 Pinto and others 2022. 214 Lopes da Silva, Tian and Marksteiner 2021;  Pettersson and others 2021.  215 UNDP 2022b. 216 Aas Rustad 2021; UNDP 2022b. 217 Arasmith, Østby and Aas Rustad 2022. 218 Collins, Florin and Sachs 2021; Darbyshire  2021. 219 Burke, Hsiang and Miguel 2015; Hsiang, Burke  and Miguel 2013; Mach and Kraan 2021. 220 McCool and others 2022. 221 UNDP 2022b. 222 Consider the 20-fold increase in water- related conflicts since 1970 (SIPRI 2021) or the  contestations around mineral resources (Aas  Rustad and others 2022). 223 Lazard 2021. 224 UNDP 2021a. 225 Keys and others 2019; Polasky and others  2020; Wassénius and Crona 2022.

CHAPTER 2 1 Distress is defined as “the negative stress  response, often involving negative affect and  physiological reactivity: a type of stress that  results from being overwhelmed by demands,  losses, or perceived threats.” It implies  “a  negative emotional state in which the spe - cific quality of the emotion is unspecified or  unidentifiable”  (American Psychological As - sociation 2022). 2 These concepts are based on Sen (1999). 3 Mani and others 2013; Ridley and others  2020; WHO 2022b. 4 Martha Nussbaum and others have repeat - edly argued that emotions are crucial in the debate of human development. Nussbaum  considers emotions one of her 10 fundamen - tal capabilities, pointing out the importance of  love, grief, longing, gratitude and justified an - ger without having these emotions distorted  by fear and anxiety (Nussbaum 2003a).

Not only  do different cultures have different “tool kits”  with habits, skills and styles that people use to  develop action strategies, but most important,  patterns of human thought develop in cul - tural settings, shaping the functioning of our  minds. In unsettled times culture also shapes  people’s behaviour through persisting ide - ologies that people apply to determine their  actions (Lamont and others 2017; Nisbett and  Norenzayan 2002; Swidler 1986; Tomasello  2016). 7 The literature finds, for instance, that fearful  people have a stronger risk aversion than  angry people, who tend to make risk-seeking  choices (Lerner and Keltner 2001). 8 Gordon and Mendes 2021. 9 Human development is the process of enlarg - ing people’s choices so that each and every  individual can develop his or her full potential  (UNDP 1990). 10 The concept of resilience is used in many dif - ferent ways in the psychology literature but is  used here in the sense of mental immunity,  in which people do not develop mental disor - ders despite facing toxic stress (Davydov and  others 2010). 11 Brännlund, Strandh and Nilsson 2017. 12 Bubonya, Cobb-Clark and Wooden 2017. 13 Callander and Schofield 2018. 14 Saxena 2018. 15 Sen 1979, 1989, 1997a, 1999, 2008. 16 McEwen and McEwen 2017. 17 Center on the Developing Child 2013, 2021;  National Scientific Council on the Developing  Child 2020. 18 Center on the Developing Child 2021. 19 McEwen and McEwen 2017; National Scien - tific Council on the Developing Child 2020. 20 Dallman 2010; Danese and Lewis 2017;  Danese and others 2014; Evans and Wachs  2010; Hackett and Steptoe 2017; Hughes and  others 2017; Morris and others 2019. 21 Ignatow 2021. 22 Basic trust refers to the trust that is developed  during infancy when needs are met by care - givers. The baby develops trust in itself, the  world and those who surround it. This trust  develops further during childhood, when  children can consistently rely on caregivers  (Erikson 1993). 23 Center on the Developing Child 2013, 2021;  McEwen and McEwen 2017.

Since this is a new area of research,  some of these studies point out that more  research is needed to fully confirm this effect  and explain the channels through which it  works. 30 Lengfelder 2021. These are what Martha  Nussbaum considers essential capabilities  (Nussbaum 2003a, 2015). 31 Ungar and Theron 2020. 32 For example, more than 55 million people  around the world live with dementia, with  almost 10 million new cases every year. De - mentia results from a variety of diseases and  injuries with impact on the brain. Alzheimer’s  disease is the most common form of demen - tia and contributes to about 60–70 percent of  cases (WHO 2021b). 33 UNDP 2020a. 34 Berry, Bowen and Kjellstrom 2010; Berry and  others 2018; Cianconi, Betrò and Janiri 2020;  Crabtree 2012; Hayes and others 2018; Padhy  and others 2015; Palinkas and Wong 2020. 35 Berry, Bowen and Kjellstrom 2010. 36 Cianconi, Betrò and Janiri 2020; Miles-Novelo  and Anderson 2019; Padhy and others 2015. 37 For a detailed analysis about this—including  two case studies, one on Finland and one on  Tuvalu—see Crabtree (2022b). 38 Clayton 2020; Taylor 2020. 39 A recent survey involving 10,000 young  people (ages 16-25) from 10 countries from  around the world found that over 60 percent  of young people are sad, afraid or anxious  about climate change. Many of them feel that  governments are failing young people (65  percent) or are even lying about the impact  of their actions in response to climate change  (64 percent). Only a few think that govern - ments act in line with recommendations from  scientific research (36 percent; Thompson  2021). 40 Middleton and others 2020. 41 UNDP 2020a. 42 National Scientific Council on the Developing  Child 2020. 43 Carter and others 2011; Hjelm and others  2017; McLaughlin and others 2012. In New  Zealand distress was higher among women  and girls than among men and boys, while in  the United States adolescents’ mental health  was impaired by food insecurity, with the ef - fect remaining significant even after extreme  poverty was controlled for.44 Trudell and others 2021. 45 Cunsolo and Ellis. 2018; Maguire 2020;  Middleton and others 2020; Willox and others  2013. 46 Middleton and others 2020. Interactions  between biodiversity and mental wellbeing  remain poorly understood, with studies con - ducted among wealthier populations yielding  mixed and inconclusive results (Hedin and  others 2022; IPBES 2019a; Marselle and oth - ers 2019). This suggests there may be differ - ential impacts of biodiversity loss on different  groups of people, with certain species more  central to the identity of some social groups  than others (IPBES 2019a, p.  323–324; Mar - selle and others 2019; see also Wheeler and  others 2015). 47 Altman and Jordan 2018; Ebi and others 2007;  Gentle and Maraseni 2012; Tankari 2018. 48 Carlson and others 2022. 49 Czeisler and others 2020; Gao and others  2020; WHO 2022a. 50 WHO 2022a. 51 WHO 2022c. 52 Varma and others 2021.

Its findings were echoed by another multi - country study in which female caregivers of  children ages 5–18 across Australia, Canada,  the United Kingdom and the United States  experienced higher levels of distress, anxiety  and post-traumatic stress than male caregiv - ers (Wade and others 2021). 58 Proto and Quintana-Domeque 2021. 59 Bender and Theodossiou 2018; Christian,  Hensel and Roth 2019; Hjelm and others  2017; Johnston, Shields and Suziedelyte  2020; Kopasker, Montagna and Bender 2018;  Martin-Carrasco and others 2016; Ridley and  others 2020. 60 Biasi, Dahl and Moser 2021; Ridley and others  2020.61 Smith and others 2021. 62 Persson and Rossin-Slater 2018; Ridley and  others 2020. 63 McEwen and McEwen 2017. A study from  Ghana shows that in cacao-producing regions  decreases in cacao prices by the time a child  is born have adverse effects on the child’s  mental health that last until adulthood and  can result in fewer economic opportunities  (Adhvaryu, Fenske and Nyshadham 2019). 64 Diorio and Meaney 2007. 65 National Scientific Council on the Developing  Child 2020. 66 Troller-Renfree and others 2022. Similarly,  another study from Malawi shows how uncon - ditional cash transfers improve mental health  among young people, especially among  young women (Angeles and others 2019). In a  different setting unconditional cash transfers  in Zambia did not reduce stress levels, even  though stress levels were highly correlated  with perceived food insecurity, which was  improved by the extra income (Hjelm and oth - ers 2017). The positive effect of cash transfers  on mental wellbeing is also valid for adults in  low- and middle-income countries (McGuire,  Kaiser and Bach-Mortensen 2022). 67 Evans and Kim 2012; Evans and Wachs 2010;  McEwen and McEwen 2017. 68 Wuepper and Lybbert 2017. 69 Evans, Li and Whipple 2013. 70 Evans, Li and Whipple 2013; O’Rand and  Hamil-Luker 2005.

The mitiga - tion of mental health issues through cash  transfers and other government programmes  has been observed in other settings as well.  See endnote 66 on African case studies and  Cooney and Shaefer (2021) for an example  from the United States. 74 Watson and Osberg 2017. 75 Knabe and Rätzel 2011. 76 Hussam and others 2021.

When comparing  socioeconomic status within countries,  people with low socioeconomic status in de - veloped countries suffer higher psychological  burden than people with low socioeconomic  in developing countries. Religion may play a  role in this association, as religious norms al - leviate the burden of poverty (Berkessel and  others 2021). In countries with a strong long- standing presence of Christian churches, one  of the cultural differences that was identified  with respect to other countries was less con - formity and more individualism among people  220 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 (Gelfand 2019). Alternative or complementary  explanations, apart from church influence,  are the effect of perceived inequality, social  comparison and peer pressure that cause  psychological burden for the low-income  population in some developed countries  (Wilkinson and Pickett 2009). 79 Marmot 2005; Ridley and others 2020. 80 Genicot and Ray 2020; McKenzie, Mohpal  and Yang 2021. See also UNDP (2019). 81 The ability to appear in public without shame,  first suggested by Adam Smith, is crucial to  the human development approach, not least  because it impacts agency—the ability to act  and bring about change (Sen 2005). 82 Lundberg, Kristenson and Starrin 2009. For  some people, growing prosperity is reflected  in the “American Dream” of faring better than  one’s parents, which may be more difficult to  achieve now than it was a few decades ago— not least because of a mismatch between  expectations based on past conditions and  available opportunities in the present (hys - teresis; Lamont 2019). See also commentary  by Frye (2019). On the argument about hys - teresis, see Ayala-Hurtado (2021). In light of  massive uncertainties, cultural braiding—the  process of “creatively redefining, melding  and combining elements from pre-existing  cultural repertoires that form the cultural sup - ply on which people draw to form their  worldviews”—may help younger generations  overcome the mismatch between expecta - tions and reality and adapt to and navigate an  unpredictable future (Zilberstein, Lamont and  Sanchez 2021, p. 3). 83 Pleeging, Burger and van Exel 2021. Educa - tion and political systems seem to play a role  in the relation among believe, hope and well - being. Case and Deaton (2015, 2020) find that  “deaths of despair” (deaths due to substance  abuse or suicide) have risen substantially  among the middle-aged White working popu - lation without college degree in the United  States since the 1990s. The authors make  psychological distress partly caused by the  capitalist system responsible for this develop - ment. However, parts of their argument have  been contested. Ruhm (2018)’s study of differ - ent counties in the United States argues that  the effect of economic decline on mortality is  minimal. 84 Loibl and others 2021. 85 Evidence for the United States has consis - tently shown that college graduates who  begin their working lives in a recession earn  less for up to 15 years than those that start  work when an economy is expanding (Kahn  2010; Oreopoulos, von Wachter and Heisz  2012; Oyer 2006; Wozniak 2010). This effect  is magnified for high school graduates, and  the negative effects extend beyond income,  also affecting health, leading to higher mor - tality than those who enter the labour force  during prosperous times (Schwandt and Von  Wachter 2019, 2020). 86 For instance, a study found that the bad luck  of young men who suffered a health shock  (the study considered only the effect of pater - nal ancestry) negatively influenced the health of descendants up to grandchildren, with a  magnitude as important as in utero conditions  or children’s socioeconomic status (Costa  2021). 87 Bianchi, Bianchi and Song 2021. It is also  linked to higher risk aversion (evidence from  Japan in Shigeoka 2019), reflecting a long- term scarring of beliefs, in a persistent ex - pectation of a higher likelihood of an extreme  negative shock in the future, with long-term  costs that are many times higher than the  short-term costs typically accounted for when  there are losses in economic output (Kozlows - ki, Veldkamp and Venkateswaran 2020). 88 Mani and others 2013; Ridley and others  2020. 89 Kaur and others 2021. 90 de Bruijn and Antonides 2021; Mani and oth - ers 2013. 91 Shah and others 2018.

Psychological  treatments have been shown to be effective  and are often able to mitigate this effect, elimi - nating up to a third of the income penalty. The  benefits of treatments are strongest among  people with lower income, which indicates  potential for decreasing income inequality. 96 Alloush 2021. 97 UN 2021a. Some examples include artificial  intelligence–enabled frontier technologies  improving health outcomes by diagnosing  various diseases, saving lives and boosting  life expectancy; digital learning technologies  enhancing education outcomes by providing  virtual learning platforms and access to edu - cation to everyone with an internet connec - tion, regardless of their geographic location,  through artificial intelligence technologies  and blockchain-powered systems; public  service delivery being made more account - able, accessible and less bureaucratically  burdensome; and programmes and policies  becoming more accurate and responsive due  to big data. 98 Rotondi and others 2020. 99 ILO 2021b. 100 Robinson, Wiborg and Schulz 2018; Robinson  and others 2020a; Robinson and others  2020b. 101 Agrafiotis and others 2018; Gandhi and others  2011; Kovacevic and Nikolic 2015; Purplesec  2021; Wang, D’Cruze and Wood 2019. 102 Khan 2017. 103 Dávideková 2016; Singh and Singh 2019.104 Freed and others 2017; Kazan 2020. 105 Khandii 2019. 106 UNDP 2019. 107 Greer and others 2019. 108 Although there is no consensus on a defini - tion, suicidal ideations can be broadly under - stood as “a range of contemplations, wishes,  and preoccupations with death and suicide”  (Harmer and others 2022, p. 1). 109 Stevens, Nurse and Arief 2020. 110 Freed and others 2017. 111 Kazan 2020. 112 Abi-Jaoude, Naylor and Pignatiello 2020. 113 This type of analysis should not be limited  to dichotomous measures such as access  or no access but should consider different  dimensions of digital inequality, including in - equality in equipment, autonomy of use, skill,  social support and the purposes for which the  technology is used. Since these inequalities  change quickly, institutional aspects should  be considered to understand patterns and  interactions involving the private sector,  consumer choices and government policies  (DiMaggio and Hargittai 2001). 114 In Wuhan, China, frequent social media use  was associated with symptoms of anxiety  during the first outbreak (January–February  2020; Gao and others 2020).

In the United States, for instance, 69 percent  of women and 34 percent of men who had  experienced sexual or physical violence  with an intimate partner during their lifetime  report suffering from symptoms of PTSD,  being fearful, being concerned for safety,  needing medical care or needing help from  law enforcement and missed at least one  day of work or school (Smith and others  2018). Similarly, a retrospective cohort study  in the United Kingdom found that women  who had been exposed to intimate partner  violence were nearly three times as likely to  be diagnosed with mental disorders, almost  twice as likely to suffer from anxiety and three  times as likely to be depressed as unexposed  women (Chandan and others 2020). Likewise,  a national survey from El Salvador observed  that women who had experienced intimate  partner violence showed a significantly higher  prevalence of mental disorders and suicidal  tendencies than those who had not (Navarro- Mantas, de Lemus and Megías 2021). 138 Cimino and others 2019; Daugherty and oth - ers 2020; Ivany and others 2018; Smirl and  others 2019. 139 Brenisen 2020. 140 Greene and others 2018.

The study used  national panel data from South Africa and  found a strong link between exposure to  heightened levels of neighbourhood violence  and depressive symptoms, especially among  poor people living in urban neighbourhoods.  It argues that a psychological poverty trap  arises when individuals with lower incomes  live in neighbourhoods with lower rent and housing prices, which are often dispropor - tionately affected by violence, with detrimen - tal consequences on mental health and thus  abilities to work and generate income. 151 See also Fowler and others (2009) and Mc - Coy, Roy and Raver (2016). In Bogotá a singu - lar violent crime event near children’s homes  is associated with an increase in children’s  mental health conditions (Cuartas and Leven - thal 2020).

CHAPTER 3 1 Institutions in the broadest sense, as pro - posed by Douglass North to represent formal  rules as well as social norms and expecta - tions (North 1990), and including social ar - rangements that take the form of regulations  and other public policies. 2 One approach would be to assume how  people behave and then define an ideal set  of institutions that would deliver intended  outcomes based on those behavioural  assumptions. “There is a long tradition in  economic and social analysis of identify - ing the realization of justice with what is  taken to be the right institutional structure.  There are a great many examples of such a  concentration on institutions, with powerful  advocacy for alternative institutional visions  of a just society, varying from the panacea  of wonderfully performing free markets and  free trade to the Shangri-La of socially owned  means of production and magically efficient  central planning. There are, however, good  evidential reasons to think that none of these  grand institutional formulae typically deliver  what their visionary advocates hope, and that  their actual success in generating good social  222 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 realizations is thoroughly contingent on vary - ing social, economic, political and cultural  circumstances” (Sen 2009b, p. 83). Thus, this  approach, always fraught, may be particularly  unsuited to novel uncertain times in which a  fundamental transformation is being pursued. 3 Sen 2009b. 4 This argument is based on Sen (2009b),  contrasting contractual approaches to justice,  exemplified by several theories of the social  contract, with an approach based on social  choice, in which the world is constantly as - sessed, and injustices are addressed through  public reasoning that determines institutions  and behaviour. 5 Recognizing that capabilities are not the only  thing that matters. International cooperation  for development and social and economic  policies often focus on one aspect of capa - bilities: the deprivations and inequalities in  opportunities leading to achievements in  wellbeing, such as having income to meet ba - sic standards of living and being healthy and  educated enough to participate in economic,  social and political life. There is good reason  for this focus when the claims for assistance  from others or from the state are associated  with deprivations in these capabilities. This  focus assumes even greater force when  someone is living in extreme poverty or suf - fering from hunger. Human Development  Reports over the years have emphasized  wellbeing achievements associated with ba - sic capabilities in standards of living, health or  education — also the inspiration for the Human  Development Index (HDI). The HDI provides  a natural way to compare countries and as - sess development progress over time, in a  more informationally plural way than relying  narrowly on national income. The reversal in  HDI values documented in chapter 1 shows  how important it is to continue pursuing this  emphasis. 6 “The possibilities of affecting human behav - iour through means other than economic  incentives may be a great deal more substan - tial than is typically assumed in the economic  literature. The rigid correspondence between  choice, preferences, and welfare assumed  in traditional economic theory makes the  analysis simpler but also rules out important  avenues of social and economic change”  (Sen 1973, p. 254). 7 Rational in quotation marks to signify the nar - row perspective that assumes that people be - have rationally only if they behave according  to these assumptions. Behaviour deviating  from these assumptions does not imply that  it is irrational, only that it does not conform to  the assumptions. 8 As early as 1955, Herbert Simon (1955, p. 99)  wrote: “Broadly stated, the task is to replace  the global rationality of economic man with  the kind of rational behaviour that is compat - ible with the access to information and the  computational capacities that are actually  possessed by organisms, including man, in  the kinds of environments in which such  organisms exist.” Daniel Kahneman (2003),  a leading contributor to behavioural science,  titled his review of his contributions to the field that were recognized with a Nobel Prize  “Maps of Bounded Rationality.” 9 While the standard economic model includes  social determinants (that is, elements that  are shared and not attached exclusively to  agents), they are typically limited to either  prices or the “rules of the game” that may  be in place to constrain choice. The rules of  the game are often equated with institutions,  in the broad sense proposed by North (1990)  to represent formal rules as well as social  norms and expectations. They are part of indi - vidual beliefs that enter rational choice. For a  broader discussion of the (underappreciated)  relevance of beliefs, see Basu (2018). As Hoff   and Stiglitz (2016) argue, these social determi - nants influence only the choice sets available  to agents, not any social determinants of the  actual choice. 10 Granovetter 1985, 2005. More recently, Greif  and Mokyr (2017, p.  25) argued that beliefs  (which Douglass North assumed to be individ - ually held) are actually socially constructed on  the basis of cognitive rules that “summarize  society’s beliefs and experience.” 11 For many years some of these findings were  popularized among economists in a feature  of the Journal of Economic Perspectives  titled “Anomalies.” In one of the contributions,  it was explained that “economics can be  distinguished from other social sciences by  the belief that most (all?) behaviour can be  explained by assuming that rational agents  with stable, well-defined preferences interact  in markets that (eventually) clear. An empirical  result qualifies as an anomaly if it is difficult to  ‘rationalize’ or if implausible assumptions are  necessary to explain it within the paradigm”  (Rabin and Thaler 2001, p. 219). An early re - view of the impact of a more complex under - standing of human psychology in economics  is Rabin (1998). A more recent review of the  field is Thaler (2018). Implications for devel - opment economics have been reviewed in  World Bank (2015), Demeritt and Hoff (2018)  and Kremer, Rao and Schilbach (2019). 12 [Economic analysis] “underestimates that [a  human] is a social animal and that his choices  are not rigidly bound to his own preferences  only. I do not find it difficult to believe that  birds and bees and dogs and cats do reveal  their preferences by their choice; it is with  human beings that the proposition is not  particularly persuasive. An act of choice for  this social animal is, in a fundamental sense,  always a social act” (Sen 1973, pp. 252–253). 13 Sen 1977. 14 Paraphrasing from Dawes and Thaler (1988,  p. 196). 15 Sen 1997b, p. 749. 16 A change in goals triggers a reorganization  of the neural representation of value, which  explains flexible behaviour Castegnetti, Zurita  and Martino (2021). 17 Which may or may not be mediated through  personal wellbeing. 18 Sen 1997b, p.  751. For the interplay among  narratives and imperatives and more reason - ing, see Bénabou, Falk and Tirole (2018).19 Hoff and Stiglitz 2016. 20 Some interesting evidence about the rel - evance of reference points comes from the  times that marathon runners take to complete  the course, which are significantly bunched  around round numbers (that is, at 3 hours, 3.5  hours and so on; Allen and others 2017). 21 Unlike what is assumed in expected utility  theory, as described in spotlight 3.3 (Tversky  and Kahneman 1974). 22 The neural basis for loss aversion is docu - mented in Tom and others (2007). On the  role of the amygdala in the brain, see Martino,  Camerer and Adolphs (2010), but for cau - tion interpreting some of this evidence, see  Eklund, Nichols and Knutsson (2016). 23 Frank 2020. 24 Tversky and Kahneman 1974. The refer - ence point that people use to make these  valuations can be based on either something  people actually have or some expectation  about what they believe may or should hap - pen (Kőszegi and Rabin 2006, 2007). 25 Samuelson and Zeckhauser 1988. 26 Rabin and Thaler 2001. 27 Tversky and Kahneman 1992. Although  evidence suggests that the way in which  people acquire information about probabili - ties matters: this behaviour is observed when  probabilities are described but not necessar - ily when they are learned from experience  (Hotaling and others 2019). 28 Zelizer 1989, 2017. 29 Cohen, Shin and Liu 2019; Collins and others  2009. 30 Narrow framing was proposed to account for  the evaluation of a specific risk separately  from other risks, along with insights from  prospect theory by Benartzi and Thaler (1995)  to explain the equity premium puzzle (the fact  that average returns on risky assets such as  real estate and stocks historically exceed  those of safe assets such as short-term  bonds) by much more than expected utility  theory would predict. For the regularity of this  differential in returns across countries and  over time, see Jordà and others (2019). 31 Bordalo, Gennaioli and Shleifer 2012, 2021. 32 The case has been made many times and  in a very compelling way, as reviewed in  chapter 5 of the 2020 Human Development  Report (UNDP 2020a), for instance. 33 Present bias, giving greater weight to pro - spective gains that are coming sooner rather  than later (O’Donoghue and Rabin 1999) might  also contribute to the behavioural agent giv - ing pause. 34 Erickson and others 2020; Oreskes 2019;  Oreskes and Conway 2011; Supran and  Oreskes 2021. 35 More generally, Atkinson and Jacquet (2022)  show how many of the cognitive biases, or  psychological traits more broadly, that are  invoked as reasons why people will oppose  action on climate change have a counterar - gument that suggests they could also drive  NOTES 223 behaviour that would support action against  climate change.

Sometimes emotions  are presented as “irrational,” something that  Sen (2009b) rejects, in line with Smith’s view.  For explorations of the role of emotions in  behaviour, see Elster (1998) and Loewenstein  (2000). 53 LeDoux and Brown 2017. 54 Lerner, Small and Loewenstein 2004. 55 Dorison and others 2020. 56 Elster 2021a. 57 Lynch, Broomhall and Davidson 2019. 58 Long and others 2020. 59 Pleeging, Burger and van Exel 2020. 60 See Bechara, Damasio and Damasio (2000),  who suggest that bioregulatory processes— some conscious, others unconscious—take  expression in the form of emotions that make it  impossible to separate the emotional from the  other elements involved in decisionmaking. 61 Bechara and Damasio 2005. 62 Dunn, Dalgleish and Lawrence 2006. 63 Blanchette and Richards 2010; FeldmanHall  and Chang 2018. 64 Dukes and others 2021. 65 Lerner and others 2015. 66 This example, and the discussion in this para - graph, borrows from Sen (2009b). 67 For the review that inspired the discussion in  this section, see Bénabou and Tirole (2016).68 For the valence and instrumental value of  optimism, the extent to which people hold  generalized favourable expectancies about  the future, see Carver, Scheier and Seger - strom (2010). 69 As argued in Elster (2015). 70 Bénabou and Tirole 2016. identify three  mechanisms: strategic ignorance (for in - stance, refusing to be tested for Huntington’s  disease, despite knowing that one is at risk),  denial of reality (rationalizing, distorting or  dampening warning signs of, for instance, a  housing market crash before the incontrovert - ible crash does happen) and self-signalling  (pushing through work even though one feels  sick, to validate the belief that all is fine). 71 Kahan 2013; Kahan and others 2017a, 2017b.  Even though the robustness of some of these  findings is under scrutiny (Tappin, Pennycook  and Rand 2020), perhaps the more relevant  and robust point is that higher cognitive  achievements do not impede motivated  reasoning. 72 Christensen and Moynihan 2020. 73 Martinez 2022. 74 Thaler 2020; Van Bavel and others 2022. 75 Barron, Becker and Huck 2022. 76 Bonomi, Gennaioli and Tabellini 2021. In his  empirical account of income and voter pat - terns, Piketty (2020) demonstrates a shift in  many countries in political preferences across  income groups, where class-based or income- based voting seem to have given way to vot - ing patterns along other fault lines, such as  education (see also spotlight 4.1 in chapter 4). 77 For an argument as to how epistemic norms  are social norms, see Henderson (2020). Levy  (2022, p. xiii) puts it succinctly: “[T]hose who  come to hold bad beliefs do so for roughly  the same sorts of reasons as those who come  to hold good beliefs. It isn’t because they’re  irrational and we’re not. It is largely because  we defer to reliable sources of evidence  and they defer to unreliable. This deference,  which may be explicit or implicit, is itself  rational on both sides. Given that we’re epis - temically social animals, it’s largely through  deference that we come to know about the  world and generate further knowledge.” 78 O’Madagain and Tomasello 2022; Tomasello  2018, 2020. 79 Levy 2021; Schmelz and Bowles 2022; Sco - ville and others 2022. 80 Kahan and others 2017a; Schaffner and Luks  2018. 81 Henrich and others 2022, p. 13. 82 For an example of models contrasting po - litical choice based on interests versus ideas  (based on identity or world views), see Ash,  Mukand and Rodrik (2021). 83 We are grateful to Benjamin Enke of Harvard  University for this suggestion through direct  communication. 84 “If we want to effectively reduce political  polarization, we need to recognize the biases  that our brains impose in processing and the ways that broader institutions (e.g., media and  political systems) may shape our thoughts and  feelings. […] Only once we realize that we are  all subject to many layers of influence that our  brains seamlessly convince constitute ‘reality’  will we then be able to successfully reduce  political polarization” (Moore-Berg and others  2020, p. 28553). 85 See, for instance, Sharot and Sunstein (2020).  Box-Steffensmeier and others (2022) provide  a review of emerging findings and directions  for future research on the understanding of  human behaviour. 86 As Sen (2009a, p.  288) wrote: “Once the  priority of a social affiliation (chosen or un - chosen) is accepted as an integral part of  one’s ‘overall identity,’ something substantial  is lost. This includes the ability to recognize  easily that one has to decide on one’s social  affiliations, which does not compromise one’s  personal identity.” 87 Henrich and others (2022) review evidence  of how many cognitive biases vary across  societies, with some disappearing or revers - ing, including overconfidence, risk aversion,  the gambler’s fallacy, the hot hand fallacy,  the representative heuristic, neglecting re - gression to the mean, functional fixity and  the endowment effect. A more nuanced  view is that some features are universal, but  their manifestations vary across cultures. For  instance, hyperbolic discounting (discounting  the immediate future more than the far future)  was shown to be present in 53 countries  but with great heterogeneity for shorter time  horizons across countries (Wang, Rieger and  Hens 2016). They also appear to vary across  people depending on measures of analytical  sophistication and education level (Frederick  2005). 88 Even if there are differing views on what is  and is not universal, see Cosmides and Tooby  (2013), Cosmides, Barrett and Tooby (2010)  and Pinker (2010). For an evolutionary ac - count of the origins of hyperbolic discounting  (not limited to humans), see Dasgupta and  Maskin (2005). Often psychological evolu - tionary arguments are based on time-shifted  rationality theories, which explain what is now  described as a cognitive bias that deviates  from rational choice as resulting from the  persistence of cognition traits that evolved  to adapt to environments in the evolutionary  past. For instance, Jaeger and others (2020)  present evidence that links the magnitude  of the endowment effect to evolutionary sa - lience of different items. 89 Henrich 2020. The type of norm in question,  whether it is injunctive (prescribing behaviour)  or descriptive (where people follow how  others behaviour), also matters on the type  of emotion that has greater salience (Elster  2015). 90 Frank 1988. 91 Almås and others 2022; Falk and others 2018;  Huppert and others 2019. 92 To use the expression of Hoff and Stiglitz  (2016).

Key contributions to this  understanding of culture include DiMaggio  1997, Patterson 2014 and Swidler 1986. An  early account of culture consistent with this  perspective comes from Geertz (1973). See  also Amenta and Polletta (2019) and Bonn  (2015). That a person’s sense of self has  behavioural implications is recognized in  economic models of identity such as those  by Akerlof and Kranton (2000), but those  models do not specify where identity comes  from, as recognized and explored in Huettel  and Kranton (2012) and Kranton and others  (2020). This perspective from sociology offers  an answer to the question of where a sense  of self comes about and how. 95 Schilbach, Schofield and Mullainathan 2016;  Schofield and Venkataramani 2021. 96 See Lamont and others (2017) for an explo - ration of the implications of this perspective  on these studies. Indeed, Lambe and others  (2020) show that development interventions  that build their understanding of behaviour  change as contextual, taking place in relation  to complex socioecological systems that also  evolve over time, are more successful in cre - ating robust and long-lasting change. 97 Sanchez, Lamont and Zilberstein 2022. 98 This includes Acemoglu (2022), Acemo - glu and Robinson (2021, 2022), Acemoglu,  Egorov and Sonin (2020) and Lowes and oth - ers (2017). 99 Richerson, Gavrilets and de Waal (2021)  provide a recent statement of the achieve - ments and potential contributions of this  perspective. 100 For an illustration of critiques and responses,  see, for instance, Henrich and others (2016)  and Richerson and others (2016). See also  Mesoudi (2016, 2021) and Sterelny (2017). 101 Apicella, Norenzayan and Henrich 2020;  Henrich 2020. 102 The sliver of humanity has been associ - ated with the acronym WEIRD—Western,  educated, individualistic, rich and democratic,  referring to the overwhelming overrepresen - tation of people with these characteristics  in experimental findings in behavioural eco - nomics. Sometimes observed behaviour by  WEIRD people deviates from the rational  choice model—thus, described as some of  the biases discussed above—in other cases  behaviour consistent with rational choice is  observed in non-WEIRD populations (Api - cella, Norenzayan and Henrich 2020; Henrich  2020; Henrich, Heine and Norenzayan 2010a,  2010b; Muthukrishna and others 2020). 103 Falk and others 2018. 104 Henrich and others 2022, p.  3. Culture  develops and is transmitted through social  learning and affects not only how people  solve specific problems but also how they  conceptualize the world and think of their  selves. Culture shapes “core aspects of  our attention, perception, thought, memory,  reasoning, motivations, mentalizing abilities, decision heuristics/biases or moral intuitions,  […and] what constitutes a good argument or  solid evidence” (Henrich and others 2022,  p. 1). Boyd, Richerson and Henrich 2011. 105 Gelfand and others 2011; Jackson, Gelfand  and Ember 2020. 106 Gelfand and Jackson 2016. 107 Morris, Chiu and Liu 2015; Vignoles and oth - ers 2016. The huge variation in beliefs and  values occurs even within a shared cultural  setting. In fact, a set of cultural attributes and  the psychological traits associated with it do  not have a one-to-one counterpart at the indi - vidual level (Na and others 2010). That is, just  because one society can be associated with  a cultural and psychological package charac - terized by, say, more individualistic traits and  another society can be characterized by more  interdependent psychological traits does not  mean that everyone in the first society is indi - vidualistic and everyone in the second is not.  For instance, Markus (2016) and Markus and  Kitayama (1991) have shown that the United  States is a more individualistic culture valu - ing independence than Japan but that within  the United States. However, Grusky, Hall and  Markus (2019) found that some disadvan - taged groups in the United States behave  in a way and have an understanding of the  self that values interdependence more than  independence. Lamont (2000) shows how  different racial and socioeconomic groups in  different countries construct different frames  of how they live dignified lives, in cultural con - texts that are dominated by individualistic and  materialistic pursuits are culturally dominant  signifiers of value. 108 Henrich and others 2016; Kwon, Wormley and  Varnum 2021; Varnum and Grossmann 2021. 109 Henrich and Muthukrishna 2021; Muthukrish - na, Henrich and Slingerland 2021. 110 Enke 2019. 111 Nunn (2022), which provides the basis for the  discussion in this paragraph. 112 Buggle and Durante 2021; Giuliano and Nunn  2020. 113 Sen 1997b, p. 749. 114 Buchanan 2020. 115 Raymond, Kelly and Hennes 2021; Raymond  and others 2014. 116 Hauser and others 2014. 117 Gross and Böhm 2020; Gross and Dreu 2019;  Gross and others 2020. 118 Barrett and Dannenberg 2012; Dannenberg  and Barrett 2018. 119 Particularly the WEIRD package, perhaps a  reason for why it is emulated in many differ - ent contexts, as argued in Henrich (2020).  For instance, Santos, Varnum and Grossmann  (2017) document increases in individualist  practices and values across 78 countries over  the past 50 years or so. 120 Thompson 2021. 121 Lübke 2021, p. 153. 122 Eom and others 2016.123 Lu, Jin and English 2021. 124 We are thankful for Ravi Kanbur’s suggestion  of using the “3 I’s” framework. Institutions  can be formal—government structures, laws  and regulations—or informal—social norms,  habits and customs—and they are gener - ally understood as “rules” or constraints that  guide behaviour and give meaning to social  life (Breukers and Wolsink, 2007; Hall 1997;  North 1990; Scott 2008). Interests can be un - derstood as the agendas of different groups  or the preferences and power embedded in  policy actors. Ideas refer to the knowledge  and values held by actors regarding what or  how things are and ought to be (Pomey and  others 2010; Shearer and others 2016). 125 Ash, Mukand and Rodrik 2021. 126 Akerlof 2020; Akerlof and Snower 2016;  Meckling and Allan 2020; Shiller 2017. 127 Mokyr 2013, 2016. For instance, creating  a culture of innovation drew from cultural  entrepreneurs such as Francis Bacon and  Isaac Newton, who created focal points  around which people could coordinate new  beliefs—focal points in game theory enable  people to coordinate their actions without  the need for cooperation. For a related, also  culture-based, but slightly different argument,  see also Mokyr (2013). 128 Schill and others 2019, p 1075. 129 For models of development that can follow  different paths—more or less “green”—de - pending on “ideas,” broadly defined, see  Besley and Persson (2020, 2021) and Persson  and Tabellini (2020). 130 Schimmelpfennig and others 2022. 131 Hauser and Norton 2017. 132 UNDP 2022b. 133 Pinto and others 2022; UNDP 2022b. 134 UNDP 2019. 135 UNDP 2020a. 136 Polasky and others 2020. 137 Hacker 2018c. 138 Hogg 2021. 139 Sandel 2020. 140 Funke, Schularick and Trebesch 2016. 141 See, for example, Makridis and Rothwell  (2020) on how polarization and partisanship  influenced the effectiveness of public health  policies and Bruine de Bruin, Saw and Gold - man (2020) on how political preferences  determined risk perceptions and willingness  to follow public health mandates in the United  States during the pandemic. 142 Levy 2022. 143 Bordalo, Gennaioli and Shleifer 2012, 2021. 144 Similarly, recognizing that evolutionary  processes may play a role in the changes  of behaviour and institutions is important to  understand cultural variation and change but  does not mean that purposeful reasoning is  abandoned as we wait for selection to do its  work. We may not have enough time to wait  NOTES 225 for relevant evolutionary processes to play  out. Here, again, we have to think ahead. 145 To use the expression of Sen (2009b) when  discussing how beliefs created under spe - cific “positional features” form and are hard  to change. The example given by Sen is that  of someone in a position who does not have  knowledge of distance-dependent projec - tions and no other information about the sun  and the moon as seen from Earth and con - cludes that they are of the same size (as they  appear to be when observed from Earth). 146 Lees 2022. 147 Mernyk and others 2022. 148 Fernbach and Van Boven 2022. 149 Fernbach and Van Boven 2022. See also, for  example, experimental evidence by Bursztyn,  González and Yanagizawa-Drott (2018), who  show that men in Saudi Arabia tend to under - estimate the support for female labour force  participation among their neighbours and that  revealing information about the actual level  of support tends to shift attitudes in favour of  women working outside the home. 150 Muthukrishna and Henrich 2016. 151 Indeed, part of the deteriorating support for  democratic processes noted in chapter 1 may  be found in perceptions of a system that is  unfair and rigged, stacked against the aver - age person, where those process fail to ef - fectively channel different voices and deliver  on concerns. Pinto and others (2022) note  declining attitudes towards democracy along - side increased perceptions of corruption  and government inefficiency. UNDP (2021b)  shows how the stark concentration of power  in Latin America seems to translate into a high  share of people believing that their countries  are run in the interest of the few, rather than in  the interest of the citizens. 152 We are grateful to Belinda Reyers for sug - gesting that it is useful to understand what  shapes people’s behaviour and the multiple  processes through with behavioural change  and institutional reform interact and appreci - ate the inherent uncertainty associated with it.  But that is no reason to be resigned but rather  to think ahead, even acknowledging that  uncertainty will not be resolved. As argued in  chapter 1, what is required to ease planetary  pressures and to navigate uncertain futures  are transformative changes: we must go be - yond adapting to existing conditions, towards  strengthening capacities for transformations.  Specific capacities, such as learning and  reflexivity, engaging with complex dynamics  and diversity, navigating across scales and  responding to emergent processes, have  been found to be crucial (Moore and others  2018). Existing development practice has  highlighted capacities such as coordinated  decisionmaking, collective action and the  capacities to innovate and experiment and  is exploring the potential of transformative  capacities such as shift in attitudes towards  innovation and changes in cultural gender  norms, agency and leadership (Reyers and  others 2022). From a planetary perspective  the global biosphere and the diversity of life  on Earth form a critical aspect of capacities for transformative change. Biodiversity not  only mitigates, buffers and provides adaptive  capacities to respond to the turbulence and  uncertainty of the Anthropocene; it also rep - resents an undervalued and underexplored  source of options, innovation, capacities and  opportunities for human development in an  uncertain future. Moreover, transformative  change will ultimately depend on collective  capacities to see and analyse the whole  system, its social and ecological components,  their dynamics and especially capacities to  make visible and reimagine the interdepen - dencies that connect them (Moore and others  2018). 153 As argued in Cukier, Mayer-Schönberger and  de Véricourt (2022).

Data are weighted averages within countries,  with every country equally weighted. 8 Indeed, the Positive Peace Index developed  by the Institute for Economics and Peace  documents a decline in cooperative social  attitudes. This decline is linked to people’s di - minished tolerance for differing views, declin - ing trust in governments and reduced faith in  democratic institutions (Pinto and others 2022). 9 Perceived agency is lower for people facing  greater human insecurity than for people ex - periencing low human insecurity. Results are  statistically significant at the 1 percent level  for low and medium HDI and very high HDI  countries and territories. Results are statisti - cally significant at the 5 percent level for high  HDI countries and territories. 10 For instance, people who express low trust in  people with other religions are 10 percentage  points more likely to mention them as unde - sirable neighbours. Human Development  Report Office calculations based on data from  the World Values Survey, wave 7 (Haerpfer  and others 2022). 11 Enke 2019; Enke, Rodriguez-Padilla and Zim - mermann 2021. 12 The level of trust towards people met for the  first time is greater for people perceiving low  human insecurity than for people perceiving  very high human insecurity. Results are statis - tically significant at the 1 percent level for all  income groups. 13 UNDP 2022b. 14 von Hippel and Fox 2021.15 The preference for extreme political positions  (left and right) is greater for people perceiving  very high human insecurity than for people  perceiving low human insecurity. Results are  statistically significant at the 1 percent level. 16 The preferences for extreme views on  government responsibility and individual  responsibility are significantly greater for  people perceiving very high insecurity than  for people perceiving low human insecurity.  Results are statistically significant at the 1 per - cent level. 17 As part of this debate, the design of social  insurance policies has been greatly affected  by the characterization of moral hazard in the  economics literature: in the presence of asym - metric information, protecting people against  risks might increase risk-taking behaviour.  At least in the United States, this has been a  contributing factor to a shift in the distribution  of risks, increasing people’s exposure to dif - ferent types of shocks.

Mature  technology has reached sizeable deploy - ment, and only incremental innovations are  expected. Early adoption technology means  that some designs have reached markets and  policy support is required for scale-up. But  there are competing designs being validated  at the demonstration and prototype phases.  Offshore power, wind power, electric batter - ies and heat pumps are examples. Examples  of demonstration designs are carbon capture  in cement kilns, electrolytic hydrogen-based  ammonia and methanol, and large long- distance battery-electric ships. Prototype  designs are at prototype stage of a certain  scale. Ammonia-powered vessels, electrolytic  hydrogen-based steel production and direct  air capture are examples of large prototypes.  Battery-electric aircraft and direct electrifica - tion of primary steelmaking are examples  of small prototypes. Technologies at the  concept stage have just been formulated but  need to be validated. Lithium-air batteries  and electrifying a steam cracker for olefins  production are examples. 50 Brynjolfsson 2022. 51 As discussed in the 2019 Human Develop - ment Report (UNDP 2019). 52 Dean 2022. 53 Dean 2022. 54 Callaway and others 2022. 55 Brynjolfsson 2022. 56 Furman and Seamans 2018. 57 Alonso and others 2020; Furman and Sea - mans 2018. 58 See Frank and others (2019) and Genz (2022). 59 Brynjolfsson 2022; Malone, Rus and Lau - bacher 2020. 60 Acemoglu and Restrepo 2019; Autor, Salo - mons and Seegmiller 2021.  61 Autor, Salomons and Seegmiller 2021. 62 Preston 2018. 63 Meng and Ellis 2020; National Academy of  Engineering and Council 2013.64 June and others 2018. 65 Collins and Curiel 2021; Katz and others 2018. 66 Trosset and Carbonell 2015. 67 Rogers and Oldroyd 2014; Wurtzel and others  2019. 68 Lorenzo and others 2018. 69 Redford and others 2014. 70 The Royal Society 2019; Schmidt 2010. 71 Evans 2021. 72 Acemoglu and Restrepo 2020; Eeckhout  2021; Korinek and Stiglitz 2021. 73 The threats associated with the proliferation  of digital technologies are also covered in  depth in UNDP (2022b). 74 Funtowicz and Ravetz 1993. 75 Khushf 2006. 76 Jasanoff and Hurlbut 2018; Scheufele and  others 2021; Yu, Xue and Barrangou 2021. 77 Basu, Caspi and Hockett 2021. 78 See box 1.1 in UNDP (2022b).

In this context com - munity resilience can be understood as the  existence, development and engagement of  community resources by community mem - bers to thrive in an environment characterized  by change, uncertainty, unpredictability and  surprise.  11 Results from a cross-sectional and longitu - dinal research case study reveal that com - munity organizing elevates psychological  empowerment and civic engagement over  time (Speer, Christens and Peterson 2021). 12 Miranda and Snower 2022. 13 UNDP 2015. 14 UNDP 2022b. 15 Florini, LaForge and Sharma 2022. 16 Okonjo-Iweala, Shanmugaratnam and Sum - mers 2021. 17 Okonjo-Iweala, Shanmugaratnam and Sum - mers 2021. 18 IMF 2021b. 19 IMF 2021b. 20 Such arrangements depend in practice on  the efficacy of processes for making and  implementing major decisions throughout  society—in a word, governance (Florini, La - Forge and Sharma 2022). Governance is the  process through which state and nonstate  actors interact to design and implement poli - cies within a given set of formal and informal  rules that shape and are shaped by power  (World Bank 2017b). There are many impedi - ments to governance, from the distortion of  information by powerful economic interests  that diluted support to policies ranging from  tobacco consumption control to climate  change mitigation (as reviewed in chapter 3)  to corruption. Empirical evidence shows that  corruption and poor governance correlate  228 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 with lower economic growth, investment and  tax revenue (Cerra and others 2021). And  governments that are captured by vested in - terests are liable to hinder societally needed  changes rather than bring them about (Stein - berger 2018). 21 Florini, LaForge and Sharma 2022. 22 Snower 2020. 23 Mach and Field 2017. 24 Florini, LaForge and Sharma 2022. 25 Fuentes-Nieva 2022. 26 Supporting the practices of indigenous  peoples that sustain biodiversity is key, es - pecially since lands managed by indigenous  peoples—around 25 percent of global land  area—host an estimated 80 percent of global  biodiversity (UNDP 2020a). 27 UNDP 2020a. 28 McGregor 2009; Whyte 2013. 29 McCrea, Walton and Leonard 2014. 30 Fishback 2022. 31 This paragraph is based on Fishback (2022). 32 Upper 2017. 33 Zurbrügg 2022. 34 Edwards 2021; Upper 2017; Zurbrügg 2022. 35 IMF 2017. 36 IMF 2017. 37 Cicchiello and others 2021; Huambachano  2018. 38 Demirguc-Kunt and others 2022. 39 Kasman, Heuberger and Hammond 2018. 40 Hanna and Olken 2018; Ravallion 2017. 41 Molina and Ortiz-Juarez 2020; Yang and oth - ers 2016. 42 Ruckert, Huynh and Labonté 2018. 43 Hanna and Olken 2018. 44 Korinek and Stiglitz 2021. 45 Coote and Percy 2020; Gough 2021. 46 UNDP 2022b. 47 Gough 2019. 48 Dein 2020; Igreja, Kleijn and Richters 2006;  Kpobi and Swartz 2019.

The Covid-19 pandemic,  now in its third year, continues to spin off new variants. The  war in Ukraine reverberates throughout the world, causing  immense human suffering, including a cost-of-living crisis.  Climate and ecological disasters threaten the world daily.  It is seductively easy to discount crises as one-offs, natural  to hope for a return to normal. But dousing the latest fire or  booting the latest demagogue will be an unwinnable game  of whack-a-mole unless we come to grips with the fact that  the world is fundamentally changing. There is no going back.  Layers of uncertainty are stacking up and interacting to  unsettle our lives in unprecedented ways. People have faced  diseases, wars and environmental disruptions before. But the  confluence of destabilizing planetary pressures with grow - ing inequalities, sweeping societal transformations to ease  those pressures and widespread polarization present new,  complex, interacting sources of uncertainty for the world and  everyone in it. That is the new normal. Understanding and responding to  it are the goals of the 2021/2022 Human Development Re - port, Uncertain Times, Unsettled Lives: Shaping our Future in  a Transforming World . It caps a trilogy of Reports beginning  with the 2019 Report on inequalities, followed by the 2020  Report on the risks of the Anthropocene—where humans have  become a major force driving dangerous planetary change. Thirty-two years ago, the very first Human Development  Report declared boldly that “people are the real wealth of  nations.” That powerful refrain has guided UNDP and its Hu - man Development Reports ever since, with its messages and  meanings taking on richer hues over time.  People around the world are now telling us that they feel  ever more insecure. UNDP’s Special Report on Human Se - curity, launched earlier this year, found that six out of seven  people worldwide reported feeling insecure about many  aspects of their lives, even before the Covid-19 pandemic. Is it any wonder, then, that many nations are creaking  under the strain of polarization, political extremism and  demagoguery—all supercharged by social media, artificial  intelligence and other powerful technologies? Or that, in a stunning reversal from just a decade ago,  democratic backsliding among countries has become the  norm rather than the exception? Or that, in a stunning first, the global Human Development  Index value has declined for two years in a row in the wake  of the Covid-19 pandemic? People are the real wealth of nations, mediated through  our relationships with our governments, with our natural en - vironments, with each other. Each new crisis reminds us that  when people’s capabilities, choices and hopes for the future  feel dashed, the wellbeing of their nations and the planet are  the accompanying casualties. Now let us imagine the reverse: what our nations, our  planet, would look like if we expanded human development,  including people’s agency and freedoms. That would be a  world where our creativity is unleashed to reimagine our fu - tures, to renew and adapt our institutions, to craft new stories  about who we are and what we value. It would be not just a  nice-to-have; it would be a must-have when the world is in  ongoing, unpredictable flux.  We got a glimpse of what is possible in the Covid-19 pan - demic. A battery of new vaccines, including some based on  revolutionary technology, saved an estimated 20 million lives  in one year. Let that sink in, that extraordinary achievement  in the annals of humankind. Equally extraordinary is the num - ber of unnecessary lives lost, especially in low- and middle- income countries, from highly unequal vaccine access. The  pandemic has been a painful reminder of how breakdowns in  trust and in cooperation, among and within nations, foolishly  constrain what we can achieve together. The hero and the villain in today’s uncertainty story are  one in the same: human choice. It is far too glib to encour - age people to look for silver linings or to state that the glass  is half full rather than half empty, for not all choices are the  same. Some—arguably the ones most relevant to the fate of  our species—are propelled by institutional and cultural iner - tia, generations in the making.  This year’s Report invites us to take a hard look at ossi - fied and oversimplified assumptions about human decision - making. Institutions assume away people’s messiness—our  emotions, our biases, our sense of belonging—at our peril.  As with its predecessors, the Report also challenges  conventional notions of “progress,” where self-defeating  tradeoffs are being made. Gains in some areas, as in years of  schooling or life expectancy, do not compensate for losses  in others, as in people’s sense of control over their lives. Nor  can we enjoy material wealth at the expense of planetary  health. This Report firmly positions human development not just  as a goal but as a means to a path forward in uncertain times,  reminding us that people—in all our complexity, our diversity,  our creativity—are the real wealth of nations. Achim Steiner   Administrator   United Nations Development Programme FOREWORD iii HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 AcknowledgementsWe live in a world of worry: the ongoing  Covid-19 pandemic, continuing regional  and local conflicts, record-breaking  temperatures, fires and storms. Many  reports document these challenges and  initiatives and offer recommendations on  how to address them, but this year’s Hu - man Development Report is an invitation  to take a step back. Many challenges,  rather than being separate, may be trou - bling manifestation of an emerging, new  uncertainty complex that is unsettling  lives around the world. The 2019 Human  Development Report explored inequali - ties in human development, the 2020  Human Development Report focused  on how those inequalities drive and are  exacerbated by the dangerous planetary  change of the Anthropocene, and the  2022 Special Report on Human Security  examined the emergence of new forms  of insecurity. The 2021/2022 Human  Development Report unites and extends  these discussions under the theme of  uncertainty  — how it is changing, what it  means for human development and how  we can thrive in the face of it. The linger - ing effects of the pandemic made pre - paring the Report challenging, including  through delays in key data availability.  The Report was made possible because  of the encouragement, generosity and  contributions of so many, recognized  only imperfectly and partially in these  acknowledgments. The members of our Advisory Board,  led by Michèle Lamont and Tharman  Shanmugaratnam as co-chairs, sup - ported us in multiple and long virtual  meetings, providing extensive advice on  four versions of lengthy drafts. The other  members of the Advisory Board were  Olu Ajakaiye, Kaushik Basu, Diane Coyle,  Oeindrila Dube, Cai Fang, Marc Fleur - baey, Amadou Hott, Ravi Kanbur, Ha - rini Nagendra, Thomas Piketty, Belinda Reyers, Dan Smith, Qixiang Sun, Ilona  Szabó de Carvalho, Krushil Watene and  Helga Weisz. Complementing the advice from our  Advisory Board, the Report’s Statistical  Advisory Panel provided guidance on  several methodological and data aspects  of the Report  — in particular those related  to calculating the Report’s human devel - opment indices. We are grateful to all the  panel members: Mario Biggeri, Camilo  Ceita, Ludgarde Coppens, Koen Decan - cq, Marie Haldorson, Jason Hickel, Steve  Macfeely, Mohd Uzir Mahidin, Silvia  Montoya, Shantanu Mukherjee, Michaela  Saisana, Hany Torky and Dany Wazen.

Their ongoing support is much appreci - ated and remains essential. We are grateful for the highly profes - sional work of our editors and layout  artists at Communications Development  Incorporated  — led by Bruce Ross-Larson  with Joe Caponio, Meta de Coquereau - mont, Mike Crumplar, Christopher Trott  and Elaine Wilson. Bruce, in particular,  has been a constant source of sound  advice, inspiration and, not infrequently,  motivation. As always, we are extremely grateful  to UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.  Facing the demands of leading an orga - nization during unprecedented times, he  always found time to give probing advice  and to provide encouragement. He has  consistently given the team the freedom  to explore and to venture beyond well- trodden paths. At a time when expanding  freedoms is essential to navigate uncer - tainties, we hope to have made good use  of that incredible trust and commitment  to the editorial independence of every  Human Development Report.

The ongoing Covid-19  pandemic, which has driven reversals in human de - velopment in almost every country and continues to  spin off variants unpredictably. War in Ukraine and  elsewhere, more human suffering amid a shifting  geopolitical order and strained multilateral system.  Record-  breaking temperatures, fires and storms, each  an alarm bell from planetary systems increasingly out  of whack. Acute crises are giving way to chronic, lay - ered, interacting uncertainties at a global scale, paint - ing a picture of uncertain times and unsettled lives. Uncertainty is not new. Humans have long worried  about plagues and pestilence, violence and war, floods  and droughts. Some societies have been brought to  their knees by them. At least as many have embraced  emerging, unsettling realities and found clever ways  to thrive. There are no inevitabilities, just tough un - knowns whose best answer is a doubling down on  human development to unleash the creative and co - operative capacities that are so essentially human. Novel layers of uncertainties are interacting to create  new kinds of uncertainty  — a new uncertainty complex   — never seen in human history (figure 1). In addition to  the everyday uncertainty that people have faced since time immemorial, we are now navigating uncharted  waters, caught in three volatile crosscurrents: • The dangerous planetary change of the  Anthropocene.1 • The pursuit of sweeping societal transformations  on par with the Industrial Revolution. • The vagaries and vacillations of polarized societies. Navigating this new uncertainty complex is ham - pered by persistent deprivations and inequalities in  human development. The past decade finally placed  inequality under a spotlight, but less illuminated  were the ways that inequalities and uncertainty con - tribute to insecurity and vice versa. The variation in  opportunity and outcome among and within nations  is mirrored by  — and interacts with  — the volatility  that people experience in their lives. Complicating  matters is a geopolitical order in flux, hamstring - ing a multilateral system designed for postwar, not  postmillennium, challenges and creaking under the  weight of naked national interests. The Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine  are devastating manifestations of today’s uncer - tainty complex. Each exposes limits of  — and cracks  in — current global governance. Each has battered  Figure 1 A new uncertainty complex is emerging New kinds of uncertainty now  layer and interact forming a  new uncertainty complex The pursuit of sweeping societal transformations Widespread, intensifying polarization Dangerous planetary change of the AnthropoceneEveryday uncertainty that people have always faced Source: Human Development Report Office. OVERVIEW 3 global supply chains, driving up price volatility in en - ergy, food, fertilizers, commodities and other goods.  But it is their interaction that, at the time of this writ - ing, is transforming shocks into an impending global  catastrophe. UN Secretary-General António Guterres  has repeatedly warned of a prolonged global food cri - sis due to the confluence of war, pandemic and warm - ing temperatures.2 Billions of people face the greatest  cost-of-living crisis in a generation.3 Billions already  grapple with food insecurity,4 owing largely to inequal - ities in wealth and power that determine entitlements  to food. A global food crisis will hit them hardest. Global crises have piled up: the global financial  crisis, the ongoing global climate crisis and Covid- 19 pandemic, a looming global food crisis. There is a  nagging sense that whatever control we have over our  lives is slipping away, that the norms and institutions  we used to rely on for stability and prosperity are not  up to the task of today’s uncertainty complex. Feel - ings of insecurity are on the rise nearly everywhere, a  trend that is at least a decade in the making and that  well precedes the Covid-19 pandemic and the atten - dant tailspin in global human development (figure 2).Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than  6 in 7 people at the global level felt insecure.5 This  against a backdrop of incredible global progress (not - withstanding the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic)  over the longer run on conventional measures of well - being, including on many of the human development  metrics tracked by the Human Development Report.  What is going on? How does the wide-angle lens of  human development help us understand and respond  to this apparent paradox of progress with insecurity?  Such questions animate this year’s Report (box 1). One of the frustrating ironies of the Anthropocene  is that while we have more power to influence our  future, we do not necessarily have any more control  over it. From the climate crisis to far-reaching tech - nological changes, other important forces  — many of  our own making — are expanding the set of possible  outcomes, some unknowable, of any given action.  For many, getting from point A to point B in their lives  and in their communities feels unclear, unsure, hard   — harder still when persistent inequalities, polariza - tion and demagoguery make it difficult to agree on  what point B even is and to get moving.

Policies that  focus on the Three I’s  — investment, insurance and  innovation  — will go a long way in helping people nav - igate the new uncertainty complex and thrive in the  face of it (see chapter 6). • Investment, ranging from renewable energy to  preparedness for pandemics and extreme natural  hazards, will ease planetary pressures and pre - pare societies to better cope with global shocks.  Consider the advances in seismology, tsunami  sciences and disaster risk reduction following the  2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.6 Smart, practical in - vestments pay off. • Insurance does too. It helps protect everyone from  the contingencies of an uncertain world. The  global surge in social protection in the wake of  the Covid-19 pandemic did just that, while under - scoring how little social insurance coverage there  was before and how much more remains to be  done. Investments in universal basic services such  as health and education also afford an insurance  function. • Innovation in its many forms  — technological,  economic, cultural  — will be vital in responding to unknown and unknowable challenges that human - ity will face. While innovation is a whole-of-society  affair, government is crucial in this regard: not just  in creating the right policy incentives for inclusive  innovation but also in being an active partner  throughout. Deeper still are the assumptions underpinning in - stitutions that develop and implement policy at all  levels. Assumptions about how people make deci - sions are often oversimplified. The dominance of  these assumptions has occasioned a narrower set of  policy options than what is needed to navigate the  new uncertainty complex (see chapter 3). Widen - ing the set of policy options starts with recognizing  the many cognitive biases and inconsistencies we all  have in our decisionmaking. Moreover, what we de - cide is often rooted in what we value. What we value  is in turn rooted in our social context. It is contextual,  malleable. Scrutinizing unhelpful social inertias and  experimenting with new narratives must be part of  the toolbox going forward (see chapter 3). So must technology. True, technology is more dou - ble-edged sword than silver bullet. Fossil-fuel com - bustion technologies are warming the planet while  nuclear fusion promises to bottle the sun, ushering  in a new era of limitless, clean energy. With every in - ternet search, retweet and like, our digital footprints  generate more data than ever, but we struggle to use  it for the common good, and some deliberately mis - use it. In a voracious scramble for more of our data,  technology giants are concentrating in their hands  more and more power over everyone’s lives. The trick  for us is to bend technology purposefully towards in - clusive, creative solutions to challenges old and new  rather than allowing it to function like a bull in a china  shop, breaking things just because. We need technol - ogies that augment labour rather than displace it, that  disrupt selectively rather than indiscriminately (see  chapter 4). As we drift further into this new uncertainty com - plex, unknown challenges loom  — more tough ques - tions without easy answers, more self-defeating  opportunities to retreat within borders that are as po - rous to climate and technology as they have been to  Covid-19. If the pandemic is seen as a test run of how  we navigate our shared, global future, then we need  to learn from it, from the good and the bad, to figure  out how to do better. Much better.Box 1 The 2021/2022 Human Development Report extends  the conversations of earlier Reports How to understand and navigate today’s uncertainty  complex — driven by the Anthropocene, by purposeful so - cietal transformation and by intensifying polarization — is  the topic of this year’s Human Development Report. Much  attention over the past decade has been rightly paid to in - equalities. Indeed, inequalities and their emerging dimen - sions were the focus of the 2019 Human Development  Report,1 carried forward into the following year’s Report  on the socioecological pressures of the Anthropocene.2  The variations in opportunity and outcome among and  within nations also happen within people’s lives, giving  rise to more and new forms of insecurity, which were ex - plored in the United Nations Development Programme’s  Special Report on Human Security earlier this year.3 The  2021/2022 Human Development Report unites and ex - tends these discussions under the theme of uncertainty —  how it is changing, what it means for human development  and how we can thrive in the face of it.

OVERVIEW 5 The Covid-19 pandemic is a  window into a new reality Now in its third year, the Covid-19 pandemic has ex - acted a terrible toll in lives and livelihoods around the  world. It is more than a long detour from normal; it  is a window into a new reality, a painful glimpse into  deep, emblematic contradictions, exposing a conflu - ence of fragilities. On the one hand, an impressive feat of modern  science: the development of safe, effective vaccines  to a novel virus in less than a year. Having saved  tens, perhaps hundreds, of millions of lives over  the past century, especially of children, vaccines re - main one of humanity’s greatest, most cost-effective technological innovations  — ever.7 The battery of  Covid-19 vaccines is no exception. In 2021 alone  Covid-19 vaccination programmes averted nearly  20 million deaths.8 It is a lesson of the power of tech - nology to transform lives for the better at a time when  we hear so much about the ways technology can do  just the opposite. But access to Covid-19 vaccines remains appalling - ly low or virtually nonexistent in many low-income  countries (figure 3), especially in Africa, which have  endured age-specific infection fatality rates twice  those of high-income countries.9 Reaching rural  areas with weaker cold chains and fewer healthcare  workers remains difficult. Meanwhile, vaccine uptake  in many richer countries has stalled, due partly to  Figure 3 Countries’ access to Covid-19 vaccines remains highly inequal High income countries 3 in 4 people or 72%  have been vaccinated with at least one dose as of July 27, 2022 Low income countries 1 in 5 people or 21%  have been vaccinated with at least one dose as of July 27, 2022 Source: Global Dashboard for Vaccine Equity ( https://data.undp.org/vaccine-equity/ ), accessed 27 July 2022. 6 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 perplexing disputes about vaccines generally.10 The  last mile is long in every country. Unequal, unjust access to Covid-19 vaccines is  one of many inequalities that have weighed heavily  throughout the pandemic. Indeed, those inequalities  have helped fuel its spread. The groups most likely to  be left behind have borne the brunt of its health and  economic risks. Women and girls have shouldered  even more household and caregiving responsibili - ties, while violence against them has worsened (see  chapter 2).11 Pre-existing digital divides have wid - ened gaps in children’s education access and quality.12  Some fear a “lost generation” of learners.13 For people everywhere the Covid-19 pandemic  has generated questions without easy answers, fore - most among them: When is this “over”? Answers  have proved fleeting, often dashed by upticks in cases  or the setting of new restrictions, forcing us back to  square one. Global supply chains remain stubborn - ly knotted, contributing to inflation in all countries   — and in some, at rates not seen in decades.14 The  implications of unprecedented monetary and fiscal  interventions aiming to rescue ravaged economies,  many still scarred by the global financial crisis, re - main largely uncertain. They unspool before us in  real time and alongside resurgent geopolitical ten - sions. The pandemic is more than a virus, and it sim - ply is not “over.” With successive waves that have caught countries  flat-footed time and time again, ongoing mutability  and the seesawing of lockdowns, the Covid-19 pan - demic and its seemingly endless twists and turns  have  — perhaps above all else  — entrenched a climate  of dogged uncertainty and unsettledness. And this  is just one pandemic, having emerged seemingly out  of nowhere, like a phantom that cannot be exorcised.  We were long warned about the threat of novel res - piratory pathogens.15 As we move deeper into the An - thropocene, we have been warned that there will be  more. A new uncertainty complex is emerging The impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on economies  pale beside the upheavals expected by powerful new  technologies and the hazards and transformations  they pose. What do investments in people’s education  and skills  — a key part of human development — look like in the face of the disorienting pace of techno - logical change, including automation and artificial  intelligence? Or in the face of deliberate, necessary  energy transitions that would restructure societies?  More broadly, amid unprecedented patterns of dan - gerous planetary change, what capabilities matter  and how? “ The impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic  on economies pale beside the upheavals  expected by powerful new technologies and  the hazards and transformations they pose Recent years have seen more record temperatures,  fires and storms around the world, alarming remind - ers that the climate crisis marches on, alongside other  planetary-level changes wrought by the Anthropo - cene. Biodiversity collapse is one of them. More  than 1 million plant and animal species face extinc - tion.16 As much as the Covid-19 pandemic caught us  by surprise, unprepared and fumbling for paths for - ward, we have even less of an idea of how to live in a  world without, say, an abundance of insects. That has  not been tried for about 500 million years, when the  world’s first land plants appeared. This is not a coin - cidence. Without an abundance of insect pollinators,  we face the mindboggling challenge of growing food  and other agricultural products at scale. Human societies and ecological systems have long  influenced  — and surprised  — one another, but not  at the scales and speeds of the Anthropocene. Hu - mans are now shaping planetary trajectories,17 and  the dramatically changing baselines  — from global  temperatures to species diversity  — are altering the  fundamental frame of reference humans have been  operating under for millennia. It is as if the ground  beneath our feet is shifting, introducing a new kind of  planetary uncertainty for which we have no real guide. Material cycles, for example, have been upended.  For the first time in history, humanmade materials,  such as concrete and asphalt, outweigh the Earth’s  biomass. Microplastics are now everywhere: in coun - try-sized garbage patches in the ocean, in protect - ed forests and distant mountaintops and in people’s  lungs and blood.18 Mass coral bleaching is now com - monplace rather than extraordinary.19 The latest International Panel on Climate Change  Report is a “code red for humanity.”20 While we still  OVERVIEW 7 have the possibility to prevent excessive global warm - ing and avoid the worst scenarios, human-induced  changes to our planetary system are expected to con - tinue well into the future. In essence, as science has  advanced, the models are, with better precision than  before, predicting more volatility.21 Any one of the rapid, planetary-level, human-in - duced changes of the Anthropocene would be enough  on its own to inject frightening new uncertainties into  the fate of not just individuals, communities or even  nations, but of all humankind. Recall just a few dec - ades ago when chlorofluorocarbons entered global  consciousness. Or the insecticide known as DDT be - fore that. Or nuclear proliferation before that (and,  sadly, still today). The human-induced forces at work  in the Anthropocene are not atomized or neatly se - quenced. They are not islands of perturbations in a  sea of relative stability. Instead, they are stacked on  top of each other, interacting and amplifying in un - predictable ways. For the first time in human history,  anthropogenic existential threats loom larger than  those from natural hazards.22 “ The layering and interactions of  multidimensional risks and the overlapping  of threats give rise to new dimensions of  uncertainty, if for no other reason than human  choices have impacts well beyond our weakened  socioecological systems’ capacities to absorb them For this reason, in its portraiture of uncertainty, the  Report does not build scenarios. Instead, it explores  how three novel sources of uncertainty at the global  level stack up to create a new uncertainty complex  that is unsettling lives and dragging on human devel - opment (see chapter 1): • The first novel uncertainty is associated with the  Anthropocene’s dangerous planetary change and  its interaction with human inequalities. • The second is the purposeful if uncertain transition  towards new ways of organizing industrial societies  — purporting transformations similar to those in the  transition from agricultural to industrial societies.23 • The third is the intensification of political and so - cial polarization across and within countries  — and  of misperceptions both about information and  across groups of people  — facilitated by how new  digital technologies are often being used.24The layering and interactions of multidimensional  risks and the overlapping of threats give rise to new  dimensions of uncertainty, if for no other reason than  human choices have impacts well beyond our weak - ened socioecological systems’ capacities to absorb  them. In this new uncertainty complex shocks can  amplify and interact rather than dissipate; they can  be propagated in systems rather than stabilized by  them. Human pulsing of natural systems at unprecedent - ed intensities and scales is one side of the uncertainty  coin. On the other are stubborn social deficits, in - cluding deficits in human development, which make  it more difficult to navigate unpredictable outcomes  and to dial down those pulses in the first place. Con - sider the Covid-19 pandemic, which has as much to  do with inequalities, poor leadership and distrust as  it does with variants and vaccines. Or competition  for environmental resources, competition that does  not typically break down into conflict. While stressed  ecosystems can parallel grievances, grievances be - come conflicts due to social imbalances.25 Political  power, inequalities and marginalization contribute  more to environmental conflict than does access to  natural resources. Political polarization complicates matters further  (figure 4). It has been on the rise, and uncertainty  makes it worse and is worsened by it (see chapter 4).  Large numbers of people feel frustrated by and alien - ated from their political systems.26 In a reversal from  just 10 years ago, democratic backsliding is now the  prevailing trend across countries.27 This despite high  support globally for democracy. Armed conflicts are  also up, including outside so-called fragile contexts.28  For the first time ever, more than 100 million people  are forcibly displaced, most of them within their own  countries.29 The conjunction of uncertainty and polarization  may be paralyzing — delaying action to curb human  pressures on the planet. The real paradox of our time  may be our inability to act, despite mounting evi - dence of the distress that human planetary pressures  are causing ecological and social systems. Unless we  get a handle on the worrying state of human affairs,  we face the Anthropocene’s vicissitudes with one  hand tied behind our backs. Even when functioning properly, conventional  crisis response and risk management mechanisms,  8 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 such as various forms of insurance, are not up to the  task of global, interconnected disruption. The unco - ordinated responses to the Covid-19 pandemic are  a case in point. New strategies are needed for tail  events synchronized at the global level. Addressing  risk through diversification is difficult when volatili - ty affects the entire system rather than only parts of  it. Yet, numerous countries around the world have  been steadily chipping away at risk sharing in many  ways.30 New forms of work and their uncertainties  have become more important in technology-enabled  gig economies. Altogether, insecurity has long been  on the rise. And it has been on the rise for some groups more  than others. Against a backdrop of novel, interacting  uncertainties, people with power, wealth or privilege  have the means, to some degree, to protect them - selves privately and to shift more of the burden on to  others. The groups most likely to be left behind face a world with complex new uncertainties in which most  of those uncertainties are directed at them, heaped  on persistent discrimination and human rights viola - tions.31 It is not just that typhoons are getting bigger  and deadlier through human impact on the environ - ment; it is also as if, through our social choices, their  destructive paths are being directed at the most vul - nerable among us. Feelings of distress are on the rise nearly everywhere An analysis of more than 14 million books published  over the last 125 years in three major languages shows  a sharp increase in expressions of anxiety and worry  in many parts of the world (figure 5).32 Other research  on smaller time scales reports steady increases in  concerns about uncertainty since 2012, well before  the Covid-19 outbreak.33Figure 4 Political polarization is on the rise across the world 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 Political p olarization in 2011Political p olarization in 2021 Eastern Europe and Central Asia Latin America and the Caribbean Middle East and North Africa Sub-Saharan Africa Western Europe and North America Asia and the PaciﬁcBeing placed above the line  means that polarization  increased from 2011 to 2021 Source: Adapted from Boese and others (2022). OVERVIEW 9 Earlier this year, the United Nations Development  Programme’s Special Report on Human Security  found similarly troubling levels of perceived insecu - rity. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than  6 in 7 people at the global level felt insecure.34 Per - ceived human insecurity is high across all Human De - velopment Index (HDI) groups, and it has increased,  even in some very high HDI countries (figure 6). Po - larization has moved in tandem in recent years. In  parallel, there is a breakdown of trust: globally, fewer  than 30 percent of people think that most people can  be trusted, the lowest value on record (see chapter 4). These and other data paint a puzzling picture in  which people’s perceptions about their lives and their  societies stand in stark contrast to historically high  measures of aggregate wellbeing, including long - standing multidimensional measures of wellbeing,  such as the HDI and other indices that accompany  this Report. In sum, twin paradoxes: progress with in - security and progress with polarization. What is going on? Too often the answer is reduced to fault-finding in - quiries about whether the data or the people are wrong.  Most likely, neither. Although people tend to express a  holistic view of their lived experience, the questions asked about their lives often focus on specific, measur - able subsets of that experience: years of schooling, life  expectancy, income. However important these metrics  are — and they are  — they do not capture the totality of  a lived experience. Nor were they ever intended to re - flect the full concept of human development, which  goes well beyond achievements in wellbeing, such as  reducing poverty or hunger, to include equally impor - tant notions of freedoms and agency, which together  expand the sense of possibility in people’s lives. Nor do  individual achievements necessarily capture social co - hesion and trust, which matter to people in their own  right and for working together towards shared goals. In  short, the twin paradoxes invite a hard look at narrow  conceptions of “progress.” The 2019 Human Development Report empha - sized going beyond averages to understand the wide  and growing variation in capabilities within many  countries. It identified widening gaps in enhanced  capabilities, such as access to higher education and  life expectancy at age 70, gaps that might also help  explain the apparent disconnect between what peo - ple say about their lives and what we measure about  them. These are not either-or explanations; all are  possible, even probable.35Figure 5 Negative views about the world surges to unprecedented highs English, United States  (90% conﬁdence interval) Spanish (95% conﬁdence interval) German (95% conﬁdence interval) Null-model (95% conﬁdence interval) 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 20202.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 –0.5z-score World War IWall Street crashWorld War IIGreat Recession Note: Negative views are defined as textual analogues of cognitive distortions in one- to five-word sequences reflecting depression, anxiety and other dis - tortions, published in 14 million books in English, Spanish and German over the past 125 years.

Achieving  gains may become harder, securing them harder still.  Backsliding may become more sudden or common or  both; it has already become evident during the Covid- 19 pandemic. For the first time on record, the glob - al HDI value declined, taking the world back to the  time just after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for  Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement.  Every year a few different countries experience dips in  their respective HDI values. But a whopping 90 per- cent of countries saw their HDI value drop in either  2020 or 2021 (figure 7), far exceeding the number that  experienced reversals in the wake of the global finan - cial crisis. Last year saw some recovery at the global  level, but it was partial and uneven: most very high  HDI countries notched improvements, while most of  the rest experienced ongoing declines (figure 8). The goal of human development is to help people  lead lives they value by expanding their capabilities,  which go beyond wellbeing achievements to include agency and freedoms. If uncertainty forms storm  clouds over all aspects of human development, then it  hurls lightning bolts at the idea of agency. It can disem - power. Choices mediate the translation of one’s values  and commitments into achievements, but the idea of  choice becomes ever more abstract, no matter how for - mally educated or healthy we may be, if we doubt that  the choices we make will yield the outcomes we desire.  Losing perceived control rather than simply not having  it in the first place has its own negative consequences,  as do the knock-on effects: a tendency to identify cul - prits or villains, a distrust of institutions and elites, and  greater insularity, nationalism and social discord. Un - certainty can turn up the heat on a toxic brew. Technology use is a double-edged sword Powerful new technologies turn it up further. From  the news, products and advertisements served up  to us to the relationships we build online and in real  life, more and more of our lives are being determined Figure 6 Perceived human insecurity is increasing in most countries — even in some very high Human  Development Index countries 0.400 1.000 0.600 0.800 Human Development Index (HDI) value, 2021Increase in  perceived insecurity Reduction in  perceived insecurityVery high HDI countriesHigh HDI countriesMedium HDI countriesLow HDI countries0.15 0.10 0.05 0 –0.05 –0.10Change in Index of Perceived Human Insecurity valuea Note: Bubble size represents the country population. a.

OVERVIEW 11 by algorithms and, in particular, by artificial intel - ligence. For people who are online, every aspect of  their lives becomes commodifiable data, raising wor - rying questions about who has access to what infor - mation, especially sensitive personal information,  and how it is being used.36 The political, commercial and personal all get mixed  together in social media, which is full of loud echo  chambers because they draw eyeballs, which draws advertising and other revenues. At least half the on - line noise is from bots designed to stir the pot.37 Mis - information moves faster and farther than information  that has been subjected to reasoned scrutiny, sowing  distrust and fanning perhaps the gravest kind of un - certainty: not knowing how to distinguish between  the two.

Polarization can take  dangerous forms when different groups operate with  entirely different sets of facts and, thus, realities, es - pecially when those realities are bound up with group  identities. Technologies then turn mere disagreements  into pitched battles for survival (see chapter 4). Given the ways technology use can aggravate at  the societal level, its harmful effects at the commu - nity and individual levels may come as no surprise.  As it is in so many parts of our lives, technology is a  double-edged sword. Artificial intelligence will both  create and destroy tasks, causing tremendous disrup - tion. Synthetic biology opens new frontiers in health  and medicine while raising fundamental questions  about what it means to be human. From the invention  of writing to Gutenberg’s printing press to Marco - ni’s first radio transmissions, technologies have been  connecting people ever faster in new ways, now in - stantaneously and across great distances. Today, tele - medicine is especially valuable in digitally connected  rural areas and has been vital for mental and physical  health during the pandemic.38 At the same time, rather paradoxically, technology  can isolate. Internet use has been found to reduce of - fline interaction, political participation and various  forms of civic and cultural engagement.39 The con - sequences of substituting the digital for the real are  complex and will be made more so as virtual worlds   — the metaverse  — take up more real estate. Cyberbul - lying is an issue on social media, and angry Twitter  mobs, mobilized sometimes by disinformation, can  digitally tar and feather someone faster than in real  life. Sometimes that spills over into real-life violence  or into real-life policy. Digital addiction is a real con - cern. Random rewards in the form of likes on Insta - gram or TikTok or the adrenaline rush of clickbait  are essentially cognitive hacks that lie at the heart of  most real-life casinos (see chapter 2).40 Mental wellbeing is under assault Mental wellbeing is an important, complex issue  globally without any single driver, technological or  otherwise. Mental distress, whose prevention is a critical aspect of overall mental wellbeing, is aggra - vated by uncertainties and insecurities of all stripes:  by major Anthropocene phenomena, such as climate  change; by age-old scourges of discrimination, exclu - sion, conflict and violence; and by relatively newer  entrants, such as social media and other technologies. The uncertainties of the Anthropocene are expect - ed to undermine people’s mental wellbeing through  four main pathways: traumatizing events, physical  illness, general climate anxiety and food insecurity  (see chapter 2). The effects these and other pathways  have on children in particular are profound, altering  brain and body development, especially in families  on lower social rungs, potentially diminishing what  children can achieve in life. The 2019 Human Devel - opment Report explored how inequalities in human  development are perpetuated across generations;41  it is not difficult to see how the confluence of mental  distress, inequality and insecurity foment a similarly  injurious intergenerational cycle that drags on human  development. “ The uncertainties of the Anthropocene  are expected to undermine people’s mental  wellbeing through four main pathways:  traumatizing events, physical illness, general  climate anxiety and food insecurity Violence  — even the threat of violence, its  uncertainty  — is a major driver of mental distress.  Some survivors of and witnesses to violence suffer  trauma, which if not addressed properly can devel - op into post-traumatic stress disorder, among other  chronic health conditions, that can weigh heavily on  the choices available to them. Violence may be di - rected at one person or group of people, but it affects  everybody in its blast radius. Even perpetrators of  violence can suffer trauma due to the violent setting  that often surrounds them, as with organized crime  or gang violence.42 The losses exacted by violence extend well beyond  direct physical, mental and emotional injury or trau - ma. Violence can cause and exacerbate all kinds of  insecurities  — food, economic and so forth  — that are  themselves major drivers of mental distress. Many  kinds of violence, from interpersonal violence to or - ganized crime to armed conflict, perniciously under - mine trust in people we know and in people we do not  OVERVIEW 13 know. Breakdowns in trust may then beget more in - stability, more violence. “ Mental disorders weigh on human development  in many ways. A health issue themselves, they are  often linked to other health challenges. They can  impede school attendance and learning, as well  as the ability to find a job and be fully productive  at it. The stigma that often accompanies  mental disorders makes matters worse Then there is the loss of agency due to violence. The  complex interplay of forces, rooted in asymmetries of  power, is powerfully at work in intimate partner vi - olence, whose survivors are predominately women  and which is correlated with some measures of wom - en’s economic dependence (see chapter 2). Channels  of dominance at the societal and institutional levels  can take concentrated, wicked forms  — especially for  women, children and older people  — behind what are  meant to be the safe walls of a home, leaving those  subjected to domestic abuse with either the percep - tion or the reality of no escape. The ensuing entrap - ment of people violates human rights, constrains  agency and ultimately undercuts our collective ability  to navigate a turbulent new era. As it has been in so many ways, the Covid-19 pan - demic is ominously illustrative. During the first year  of the pandemic, the global prevalence of depres - sion and anxiety increased by more than 25 percent.43  Low-income people, especially those who struggle  to afford basic needs such as rent and food, suffered  disproportionally in several countries.44 Women, who  assumed most of the additional domestic and care  work that emerged during school closures and lock - downs,45 faced much higher mental distress than be - fore the crisis.46 Stressors need not reach the level of globalized  trauma to cause mental distress. In fact, one of the  most serious economic threats to mental wellbeing  seems to stem from repeated financial shocks, such  as income loss, especially for poor people and for  men.47 Economic insecurity  — or just the perception  of such insecurity, even if transitory  — is a major fac - tor. Mental distress is one reason why economic dis - locations, whether from globalization or automation  or phasing out fossil fuels, carry some large, underap - preciated risks.Mental disorders, such as post-traumatic stress  disorder and depression, can develop when men - tal distress is severe and untreated. Almost 1  billion  people  — roughly one in eight of us  — live with a men - tal disorder,48 providing a lower-bound estimate of  the broader problem of mental distress. Globally,  mental health issues are the leading cause of disabil - ity. Yet, of those who need mental health attention  or treatment, only about 10 percent receive it.49 On  average, countries spend less than 2 percent of their  healthcare budgets on mental health.50 Mental disorders weigh on human development in  many ways. A health issue themselves, they are often  linked to other health challenges. They can impede  school attendance and learning, as well as the abili - ty to find a job and be fully productive at it. The stig - ma that often accompanies mental disorders makes  matters worse. Mental disorders are uniquely chal - lenging because the primary instrument to navigate  life’s challenges  — the mind  — is precisely the thing  that people living with a mental disorder may not be  able to rely on. The other thing we tend to rely on is  relationships. If those also suffer, people are left even  more isolated and vulnerable. Purposeful transformations introduce  their own uncertainties Today’s new uncertainty complex is not just about the  planetary pressures of the Anthropocene and politi - cal and social polarization; it is also about purposeful  societal transformations that seek to ease planetary  pressures and leverage the positive potential of new  technologies (see chapter 1). From energy systems to  food production to transportation, easing planetary  pressures demands fundamental changes to much  of the way the world currently operates. It is a nec - essary, wildly worthwhile investment — ethically, en - vironmentally, economically  — but it comes with its  own significant uncertainties, especially for econo - mies, livelihoods and pocketbooks.51 The energy transitions required to confront the cli - mate crisis would be challenging even in the best of  times. They become more so when stacked on top of  inequalities and social fragmentation, the rapid clip  of technological disruption and dangerous planetary  change. The backlash in some countries to various  14 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 forms of energy taxation or carbon pricing is a case  in point. However welcome new renewable energy  technologies may be at competitive market prices,  they carry their own environmental costs and risks,  including those related to mining to supply the mate - rials for the world’s solar panels and wind turbines.52 People rightly worry about winners and losers  when big change is on the horizon. Yes, the green  economy could add more than 24 million jobs world - wide by 2030.53 This is an exciting opportunity for  people and planet. But these jobs will not necessarily  be in the same regions that stand to lose jobs as fos - sil fuel industries shut down. Nor will they require the  same skills as a fossil fuel–based economy. No one  seems especially interested in a bigger overall pie if  his or her piece is feared to be getting much smaller. Nor do people need forecasts or history books to  know that societal transformations  — however well  planned or not, however “good” or not — can radical - ly reshape the communities they live in, often in un - expected ways where “do-overs” are not possible if  things go wrong. Many around the world have lived  through transformations, some ongoing, in their life - times. They see them with their own eyes. The trans - formations in energy and materials required now in  the Anthropocene portend even more upheavals,  which some believe to be as large as the shift from ag - ricultural to industrial societies.54 Whether it is the advent of agriculture or the In - dustrial Revolution, previous tectonic shifts have  typically stretched across multiple generations. Now,  they can happen within a generation, in a matter of  years, introducing a new kind of uncertainty or worry.  Whether through foresight or experience, that will  influence how people think about and invest in their  lives, families and communities and hold their lead - ers accountable. These are not reasons to give up on  a green economy; we cannot afford to throw in the  towel. But if we do not understand people’s pres - ent and future anxieties and address the underlying  drivers, if we do not build trust and the promise of a  better future, progress towards purposeful, just, sus - tainable transformations is going to be even harder. The net result of today’s uncertainty complex on  development is profound. We might be facing a grow - ing mismatch between what is needed to navigate  novel, interacting uncertainties and the current state  of affairs, categorized by social arrangements (what to do — in terms of policies, institutions) and the behav - iours shaped by social context, culture and narratives  (how to do it — in terms of prevalent identities, values  and beliefs). The interplay of forces  — their scales,  speeds, unknown interactions and consequences  —  have made development pathways simultaneously  far less obvious and far more open. What should hap - pen next can no longer be taken for granted. A line - ar march of progress in which low-income countries  chase higher income ones is less relevant. In a sense  all countries are developing countries, charting a new  planetary course together, regardless of whether they  work together to do so. “ In a sense all countries are developing countries,  charting a new planetary course together,  regardless of whether they work together to do so The question is no longer simply how some coun - tries get from point A to point B; instead, it is how  all countries start moving from wherever they are to  points N, T or W  — or letters in some new alphabet —  and then course correct along the way. Development  is perhaps better seen as a process characterized both  by adapting to an unfolding unknown reality and by  purposefully transforming economies and societies  to ease planetary pressures and advance inclusion.55 There is promise and opportunity in uncertainty If necessity is the mother of invention, then the very  forces that give rise to today’s uncertainties also offer  the means to navigate them. Uncertainty engenders  the possibility of change, also for the better. Consid - er artificial intelligence, a disruptive opportunity at  least as much as a disruptive threat. Its potential for  enhancing labour is bigger than its potential for au - tomating it. New tasks, new jobs, new industries are  all possible (figure 9). Recall that most jobs came  into being in part through the task-creating effects of  new technologies: around 60 percent of people in the  United States are now employed in occupations that  did not exist in 1940.56 We do not, however, have the  luxury to wait around for the long run. The negative  displacement impacts of artificial intelligence are too  big, too likely and too fast, especially if labour-replac - ing incentives dominate its development. Policies  OVERVIEW 15 and institutions must be put into place that nudge ar - tificial intelligence towards people rather than away  from them, to unlock and frontload its potential for  positive transformation. We are already witnessing artificial intelligence’s  upside in many areas (see chapter 5). Among its many  climate-related applications, it aids in modelling cli - mate change impacts and in predicting disasters. In  education it can facilitate individualized learning and  enhance accessibility. In biology it has revolutionized  protein folding prediction, a huge boon for medicine.57 Among the many things the Covid-19 pandemic  broke open was our imaginations. It expanded the  reference points for what is possible (see chapter 5).  Consider the rapid development and distribution in  many (but not all) countries of safe, effective Covid- 19 vaccines, some based on new mRNA technologies  that hold promise for preventing and treating many  other diseases. The pandemic normalized paid sick  leave, voluntary social distancing and self-isolation,  all important for our response to future pandemics. The interventions by central banks over the past  two years dwarf their interventions in the wake of  the global financial crisis about a decade earlier. Fis - cal policy saw a sea change, too. Social protection has surged, protecting many people from even  worse impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic while pro - viding large-scale test cases of innovative ideas:  linking national registries and databases for eligibil - ity determination; expanding coverage to previously  uncovered beneficiaries, such as refugees, migrants  and informal workers; and adopting digital verifica - tion and delivery systems, among other pathbreak - ing steps.58 Civil society has been breaking new ground, too. In  many places the Covid-19 pandemic galvanized civil  society organizations to deliver emergency respons - es, in some cases taking on new functions.59 In re - sponse to expanded emergency government powers,  some civil society entities have beefed up watchdog  activities, and still others are pushing to address so - cial, economic and political imbalances laid bare by  the pandemic. As the Covid-19 pandemic has shown, the growing  mismatch between the world as it is (or is becoming)  and conventional ways of understanding and doing  things, such that more and more of life lacks an ob - vious compass or structure, can be seen as an oppor - tunity to do something new. It can be an opportunity  to imagine, experiment and create, in ways similar to Figure 9 There is much more scope for artificial intelligence to augment human activity than to automate existing tasks Tasks that  humans can doHuman tasks that could be automated New tasks that  humans can do with  the help of machines Note: Figure is illustrative.

Existing institutions  can be transformed, and new ones created, alongside  new leaders, social movements and norms. Much like  many scientists and artists, who are often responding  to practical personal and societal concerns, this pro - cess of ongoing, creative reconstruction at all levels  is a practical response to today’s uncertainty com - plex. We will have to find ways to renew, adapt and  create institutions in the face of their inevitable short - comings in an unpredictably changing world. We will  have to experiment, to cooperate, in order to thrive. If we do not — if we reinforce the status quo, when  the status quo is part of the problem, or limit our as - pirations to a “return to normal” — the gap between  a changing world and intractable norms and institu - tions will widen to a chasm. Opportunities for inno - vation and good leadership then increasingly become  dangerous vacuums in power where the allure of sim - ple recipes and the easy gratifications of finger point - ing combine to make the problem worse. There is  promise and peril in uncertainty and disruption; tip - ping the scales towards promise  — towards hope  — is  up to us. An evolving portfolio of perspectives  helps in a world of worry Tipping the scales towards promise requires that we  keep testing the fences of conventional thinking, to  embrace an evolving portfolio of perspectives from  which to draw, mixing and matching as emerging  contexts require. For instance, policies and institu - tions at all levels need to go beyond assuming that  people are only, or even predominantly, self-inter - ested (see chapter 3). This assumption remains high - ly relevant, but it is does not encompass the totality  of human behaviour. Its limitations have been high - lighted and addressed, at least partially, by com - plementary and pioneering work in behavioural  economics. Still, we must reach for broader perspec - tives of human decisionmaking, ones that consider  the roles of emotions and culture and that explore  how people weave together and change value-infused  narratives about themselves and the various commu - nities they belong to. For example, our relationship  with nature needs renovation, and cultural narratives  are the foundation.“ To respond creatively and nimbly to  today’s uncertainty complex, we need to  bring down barriers to people’s imaginations,  identities and networks, to expand the  idea of what is possible in people’s lives Just as we must widen the vista on human behav - iour, notions of human development must go beyond  a focus on wellbeing achievements, however impor - tant they still are, to include the vital roles of agency  and freedoms in helping people live lives that they  value (see chapter 3). Doing so illuminates the appar - ent paradoxes of our age: progress with insecurity and  progress with polarization. A comprehensive embrace  of human development can act as a lodestar through  turbulent times when cookie-cutter policy lists sim - ply will not do. To respond creatively and nimbly to  today’s uncertainty complex, we need to bring down  barriers to people’s imaginations, identities and net - works, to expand the idea of what is possible in peo - ple’s lives. While crises can present opportunities for  pathbreaking action, we will be better off operating  deliberately and proactively rather than in a chronic  state of emergency response. In an age of layered and  interacting uncertainties, freedoms may not translate  reliably into desired achievements or outcomes. That  is the unfortunate news. But individuals, families and  communities can be empowered to experiment, to try  new things, for their benefit and for others, without  fear of being trapped in poverty, in a single identity or  in one cultural narrative. Rigidities in their many dimensions  — in ideas, in  networks, in narratives  — act as a vise on human cre - ativity; they constrain the generation of new ideas  in response to a changing world. Agency and free - doms are antidotes. Policies, institutions and cultur - al change that promote them tend to be fostered by  cultivating four motivating principles: flexibility, sol - idarity, creativity and inclusion (see also chapter 6).  These principles, which can reinforce one another,  will go a long way in making policies and institutions  more fit for purpose. The four principles can also have their own inter - nal tensions. Building systems with some stabilizing  redundancies, for example, needs to be balanced  against nimble response capacities. Still, it is hard  to be quick on one’s feet if one is constantly getting  knocked over by a financial meltdown, novel virus or  OVERVIEW 17 monster hurricane. Similarly, there is a give and take  to creative exploration and concerted, purposeful  action anchored in human rights. Striking the right  balance among the four motivating principles will be  key, and trust is essential to doing so. People will be  suspicious of the negotiation table if they fear that the  chair will be constantly jerked out from under them.  Policy development will be an iterative, trial-and-er - ror process in which we must all learn from each  other. Policies and institutions to invest, insure and innovate There are no policy panaceas, no one-size-fits-all  approaches. Even so, some policies form the build - ing blocks for countries and communities as they  navigate today’s uncertainty complex towards more  hopeful futures. They fall into three overlapping, mu - tually reinforcing categories: investment, insurance  and innovation  — the Three I’s (figure 10; see also  chapter 6). Investment should connect the dots. Nature-based  human development can protect and enhance natural  resources while protecting people from shocks, pro - moting economic and food security and expanding  the choices available to them. Such investments are  especially relevant at the local level, speaking to the need for investing in governance that is connected to  people on the ground, that builds bridges among pol - icy and institutional silos and that ensures all voices  are heard. Investments are needed, too, on the other  end  — in global public goods. The new uncertain - ty complex is often driven by global phenomena, so  responding to it can require global cooperation. The  additional investment to avoid future pandemics is  estimated to be only $15 billion a year.60 This is a tiny  fraction of the economic cost of the Covid-19 pan - demic, a cost that exceeds $7 trillion in lost produc - tion and $16.9 trillion in emergency fiscal responses.61  Investments in global pandemic preparedness make  good sense, given the devastating human costs. Insurance provides an essential stabilizing force  in the face of uncertainty. To start, structures that  manage a variety of risk in people’s lives, primarily  in various forms of social protection, need to be re - vitalized and modernized, including for people in in - formal or other precarious employment, such as gig  workers. We need to reverse course away from risk  segmentation and move towards a broader sharing of  risk. More countercyclical social protection measures  can be automatically triggered by certain indicators,  such as the loss of a job or a drop in income, while  ensuring their inclusivity. Such measures played im - portant roles in many countries in protecting people  from some of the worst impacts of the global financial  Figure 10 Making people more secure though investment, insurance and innovation Opportunities for broad participation Macroprudential policies Social protection  Access to basic services Protection of human rights Public deliberationAdaptive peacebuilding Social innovation Addressing misinformation and enhancing media literacy Data and measurementsEnergy eﬃciency Insurance InnovationInvestmentProvision of global public goods Nature-based human development Preparation to face environmental changes Source: Human Development Report Office. 18 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. One of the bene - fits of automatic triggers is that they require less polit - ical wrangling at already stressful moments, helping  target political capital to the unique features of a new  challenge rather than continually plugging holes in  leaky safety nets. Universal basic services, such as health and edu - cation, are important investments in their own right,  as evidenced in the Sustainable Development Goals,  and for inclusively expanding human development.  They also afford an important insurance function,  helping stabilize people in the face of seemingly re - lentless shocks. This can encourage experimentation.  People are loath to try new things if doing so risks  their or their family’s health and education and  threatens to yank them irreversibly down a yawning  socioeconomic ladder. “ Innovation will be at the heart of  successfully navigating the many unforeseen,  unknowable challenges ahead Investments in preparedness, not just for shocks  but also for societal transitions, can be well worth the  cost. Equally important are investments in promot - ing and protecting human rights and in deliberative  mechanisms that enable public reasoning in a par - ticipatory, inclusive way. Together they help insure  against polarization. Innovation will be at the heart of successfully navi - gating the many unforeseen, unknowable challenges  ahead. Some readymade tools will help, others will be  modified and updated for new contexts and still oth - ers will be built from scratch. In part, innovation has  to do with new technologies and ensuring that they  reach everyone. Computational capacities amount - ing to millions of Apollo missions to the moon are  now in the hands of everyone with a smartphone,  which is just about everybody.62 In developing coun - tries mobile phones have reshaped financial transfers  and access to information, such as weather forecasts  and wholesale market prices. New insurance models  are needed that respond to complex new risk para - digms: risks that are increasingly synchronized across  geographies and sectors, that span generations and  that harm natural resources. The “right” role for governments in innovation is  an important question, and governments have big roles in fostering climates for innovation. There was  widespread support when governments threw their  full weight behind Covid-19 vaccines, committing  to staggering prepurchase orders of then-unprov - en technologies. Governments were a driving force  and active development and distribution partner  throughout, ushering in and deploying a lifesaving  new technology at astonishing speed. (The contrast  with the relatively anaemic action on climate change,  no less an emergency than Covid-19, is stark.) Inno - vation policy frameworks, which are intimately tied  to other areas such as competition and patent laws,  have enormous implications across sectors, from  access to medicines and energy to food and water  security. Innovation does not have to be big to produce big  results. Major social media platforms have enact - ed policies such as notices, warnings and links to  resources in a bid to combat misinformation. For  example, links to official information by the World  Health Organization are suggested under posts men - tioning Covid-19 on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube  and TikTok. Twitter reminds users when they are  sharing an article without opening the link first (see  chapter 4). Fact-checking initiatives have been cre - ated by users on these same platforms, and media  plurality has been strengthened through new and  independent outlets that could not exist or have the  means to inform in the traditional media landscape,  often at the local and grassroot levels. Governments  can also take prudent steps to combat misinforma - tion while respecting and promoting people’s human  rights and freedoms. Sometimes the answer might not be complex. The  simple addition of the retweet button on Twitter has  enabled information, including misinformation, to go  viral. Modifying its use, as some have argued, could  go a long way in curbing some of the more troubling  features of social media.63 Course correcting in this  way  — practical solutions to practical problems  — will  be key to navigating the new uncertainty complex. Innovation is more than technologies as we un - derstand them conventionally in terms of vaccines  or smartphones. Equally important is social innova - tion, which is a whole-of-society endeavour. Adap - tive peacebuilding, which focuses on emergent  bottom-up, participatory processes rather than ad - hering to a set recipe, is a case in point.64 Much can be  OVERVIEW 19 learned from its application in Rwanda for healing,  transitional justice and conflict resolution (see chap - ter 6). Cultural change opens opportunities for collective action Policies and institutions are embedded in social con - texts, so aspects such as narratives matter a lot, too.  Everyone is immersed in social contexts, with cul - ture understood not as a fixed variable working in the  background but as a toolkit that changes over time  and that individuals and groups use strategically in  society. When it comes to choices about the future, people  appear to be motivated less by accurate scenarios of  what the future may hold than by collectively held  narratives.65 Much of the current information about  the future, in the form of assessments, such as those  issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change or Intergovernmental Science-Policy Plat - form on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services,66 are  anticipatory. As crucial as they are, it is important to  consider also having assessments towards imagining  more desirable futures.67 The importance of culture is finding its way into  many other areas, including economics and law. The  work of Robert Shiller explains dynamics in asset  prices as well as business cycles in terms of “narrative  economics.”68 Karla Hoff and James Walsh suggest  that law affects behaviour not only by changing in - centives and information (a coordination function) or  through its expressive role (as a guidepost for social  norms) but also with the potential to change cultural  categories.69 Shifting culture, for good or ill, is possible and can  happen quickly. Education can be a powerful tool to  open the potential for new perspectives in younger  generations, not just through curricula but also by en - visaging schools as spaces of inclusion and diversity.  Social recognition by elites of all types, from politi - cians and celebrities to social media influencers and  community leaders, is an important mechanism for  cultural change. Media in its many forms plays a big  role here. In Bangladesh a popular animated televi - sion show reduced the cultural and religious stigma  of girls going to school in rural areas and increased  their attendance.70 In Ghana and Kenya the Time to Change campaign made inroads into reducing men - tal health stigma.71 The issue is not just about recipients of pro - grammes or target audiences but also about who is  deciding on and delivering the messages. For exam - ple, women’s representation in political bodies shifts  policy priorities and expands aspirations for other  women and girls. Social movements have important  roles as well in advancing human rights and changing  cultural norms and narratives to expand agency and  freedoms (see chapter 6). “ Walls between our social connections  are perhaps more insidiously damaging and  polarizing than walls between nations Essential to flexible and adaptable narratives, in  building trust and social cohesion for more hopeful  futures, is the freedom for each person to have and  move among different identities in different social  contexts (see chapter 4).72 Walls between our social  connections are perhaps more insidiously damag - ing and polarizing than walls between nations. The  bridges that connect different groups are among our  most important assets. Good leaders rehabilitate and  strengthen them and help us use them  — especially  in the face of unknowns. Demagogues try to burn  them down, replacing fluid connection, exchange  and learning with zero-sum, us-versus-them narra - tives. Instead of trying out cultural scripts precisely  when experimentation matters most, people become  trapped by them. Where we go from here is up to us We must learn to live with today’s uncertainty com - plex, just as we must learn to live with Covid-19. This  year’s Human Development Report challenges us to  aspire to more than mere accommodation, however.  By unlocking our human potential, by tapping into  our creativity and diversity anchored in trust and sol - idarity, it challenges us to imagine and create futures  in which we thrive. The encouraging words of the  late, great poet and civil rights activist Maya Angelou  ring as true as ever, reminding us “to bring all our en - ergies to each encounter, to remain flexible enough to  notice and admit when what we expected to happen  20 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 did not happen. We need to remember that we are  created creative and can invent new scenarios as fre - quently as they are needed.”73 Where we go from here is up to us. One of the great  lessons of our species’ history is that we can accom - plish a lot with very little if we work together towards  shared goals. If there is a secret ingredient to human  magic, that must be it. The challenges in the Anthro - pocene and in sweeping societal transformations are  huge, even daunting, all the more so for countries and  communities struggling with the most dramatic and  unjust deprivations. Insecurity and polarization make things worse. Amid so much uncertainty, the truth is  that we are not going to get it right, maybe not even  most of the time. In this turbulent new era we can  set the direction but cannot guarantee the outcome.  The good news is that we have more tools than ever to  help us navigate and course correct. But no amount of  technological wizardry is a substitute for good lead - ership, collective action or trust. If we can start fixing  the human side of the planetary ledger  — and this Re - port tries to highlight how  — then the future, however  uncertain, will be more promise than peril, just as it  should be. OVERVIEW 21  PART I Uncertain times,  unsettled lives 24 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022PART I Uncertain times, unsettled lives Uncertainty is not new, but its dimensions today are  taking ominous new forms. A new “uncertainty com - plex” is emerging, never seen before in human histo - ry. Part I of this Human Development Report explores  what this uncertainty complex is, how it is unsettling  lives the world over and what it has to do with human  development. Chapter 1 parses the three volatile, in - teracting strands that constitute the uncertainty com - plex: the planetary pressures and inequalities of the  Anthropocene, the pursuit of societal transformations to ease those pressures and widespread polarization  across and within countries. Chapter 2 illuminates  how uncertainties of all stripes constrain human de - velopment via their negative impacts on mental well - being. Chapter 3 argues that narrow assumptions  about human behavior, alongside simplistic notions  of development progress, limit people’s ability to re - spond creatively to a world in flux. Doubling down on  human development in its fullest sense offers a hope - ful path forward in uncertain times. PART I — UNCERTAIN TIMES, UNSETTLED LIVES 25  A new   uncertainty complex PART I — UNCERTAIN TIMES, UNSETTLED LIVESCHAPTER 1 28 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022Feelings of distress have been on the rise for almost  everyone everywhere, even before the Covid-19  pandemic. Yet conventional measures of wellbeing  suggest that, on average, life has never been better  for our species. What is going on? Why are people so worried, and  what worries them? This chapter argues that a new uncertainty complex  is emerging, driven by three novel sources of  uncertainty that interact at a global scale: • The intertwined planetary pressures and  inequalities of the Anthropocene. • The pursuit of just societal transformations to ease  those pressures. • Widespread, intensifying societal polarization,  delaying necessary action for change. Together, they are painting a picture of uncertain  times and unsettled lives.CHAPTER 1 A new uncertainty complex A world of worry in uncertain times A war between countries in Europe reawakens fear  of global nuclear conflagration. A volatile geopoliti - cal context1 coexists with a pandemic that continues  to kill and frighten more than two years since it was  declared. Behind the headlines progress in human  development has gone into reverse  — with worsening  trends in poverty, food insecurity, forced displace - ment and many compounding inequalities.2 For the  first time on record, the global Human Development  Index (HDI) has dropped for two years in a row, taking  the world back to just after the adoption of the 2030  Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris  Agreement (figure 1.1). Every year a few countries face  declines on the HDI, but over 90 percent of countries  saw their HDI value drop in either 2020 or 2021 (fig - ure 1.2). Furthermore, while only a third of very high  HDI countries saw a decline in 2021 (compared with  over 90 percent in 2020), about 60 percent of low and  medium HDI and high HDI countries did (figure 1.3). There is little doubt that these are uncertain times,3  as people feel less sure about what the future holds.  Even before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, six of seven people in the world reported feeling insecure about  many aspects of their lives, with concerns rising the  most in very high HDI countries (see chapters 3 and  4 on the links between uncertainty and insecurity).4 Life has always been uncertain.5 The world has  faced wars, pandemics and massive natural hazards  before. Today’s uncertainty is not necessarily any  greater than in the past. If anything, given record  achievements in average standards of living and in - comes, with astonishing technological progress, we  could be expected to be more ready than ever to meet  uncertain times. Yet, we display high, and often ris - ing, concern about the future. So, what is going on?  Why are people so worried, and what worries them?  If today’s world is not more uncertain than the past’s,  are today’s uncertain times different? If so, how? And  how do they relate to human development? This chapter presents evidence that people are  feeling distressed and explores what they may be  worrying about. While it cannot be established that  there is more uncertainty today than in the past, there  is a novel context for uncertainty. The novelty comes  from three interacting layers of uncertainty, super - imposed on ongoing development challenges.

CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 29 first is associated with the Anthropocene’s dangerous  planetary change and its interaction with inequalities.  The second is the purposeful efforts and intentions to  transition towards new ways of organizing industri - al societies  — purporting transformations similar to  those in the transition from agricultural to industrial  societies.6 The third is the intensification of political  and social polarization across and within countries  —  and of misperceptions about information and across groups of people  — facilitated by how new digital tech - nologies are often being used.7 This new and interact - ing “uncertainty complex” is unequal and universal;  it can exacerbate inequalities, yet like the ongoing  pandemic, it touches us all. The interaction of these three layers of uncertainty  implies that threats to people and planet compound,  with events rippling through our socially and ecologi - cally connected societies in multiple and unpredictable Figure 1.2 Drops in Human Development Index values were widespread during the Covid-19 pandemic, with  over 90 percent of countries suffering a decline in either 2020 or 2021 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021Share of countries for which an  HDI value was calculated that experienced  a decline in HDI value in that year (%)Global ﬁnancial crisis 2324 17151211991397588554620 889910101112 8987 51Covid-19 pandemic Note: The period of the global financial crisis is indicative.

Consider how the war in Ukraine is compound - ing a global food insecurity crisis.8 Consider how the  Covid-19 pandemic, in addition to the health impacts,  also devastated economies and reversed progress in  gender equality.9 Many of the threats, in isolation, are  not new. But the confluence of pandemics, the inven - tion of vaccines in record time, the digital proliferation  of misinformation, the breakdown of supply chains,  the strong market concentrations for essential goods,  the loss of biodiversity  — have all interacted to present  a “complex mixture of the precedented and the un - precedented” at a speed and scale never before seen.10 Rising insecurity amid unprecedented  material prosperity — for some Large-scale text analysis identifying language trends  in books over the past 125 years reveals a sharp in - crease in expressions reflecting cognitive distortions  associated with depression and other forms of mental  distress (see chapter 2).11 Over the past two decades  the language reflecting overly negative perceptions  of the world and its future has surged (figure 1.4).12 In- deed, today’s distress levels are unprecedented,13 ex- ceeding those during the Great Depression and both world wars. The analysis of more than 14 million  books in three languages signals cultural, linguis - tic and psychological shifts beyond changes in word  meaning, writing and publishing standards or the  books considered. Indeed, literature has been thought  of as mirror of our societies, and studies show that  text expressions reflect emotional states14 and some - times anticipate broader social and political changes.15 Other studies  —on,  for example, online behav - iour16 and analysis of emotional expressions on social  media17— echo these findings.18 The Covid-19 pan - demic and uncertainty about the impacts and spread  of the disease sparked rapid surges in online search - es for acute and health- and economic-related anxie - ty.19 While reflecting the concerns of only those with  internet access, the measures coincide with survey  data20 across geographic locations.21 Still other stud - ies show that when events are sudden or unexpected,  online behaviour can indicate shared sentiments.22 People report feeling more distressed and insecure  about their lives and the future. While perceived in - security is higher in low and medium HDI countries,  some of the largest increases in feelings of insecuri - ty are in very high HDI countries (figure 1.5).23 Inse - curity, discontent and pessimism loom large across  Figure 1.4 Negative views about the world and the future have surged to unprecedented highs English, United States  (90% conﬁdence interval) Spanish (95% conﬁdence interval) German (95% conﬁdence interval) Null-model (95% conﬁdence interval) 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 20202.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 –0.5z-score World War IWall Street crashWorld War IIGreat Recession Note: Negative views are defined as textual analogues of cognitive distortions in one- to five-word sequences reflecting depression, anxiety and other  distortions, published in 14 million books in English, Spanish and German over the past 125 years.

CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 31 all geographic regions, including countries with the  highest incomes, with some surveys finding that  younger people tend to have a more positive outlook  on the future in some lower-income countries.24 For  instance, while the mentions of threats, such as those  from conflict or natural hazards, in US newspapers  steadily declined from 1900 to about 2010, they have  since shot up, with forecasts of further increases in  coming decades.25 The numbers of people reporting negative affect  —  stress, sadness, anger or worry   and experiencing physi - cal pain—have been on the rise for the past decade and  have hit a record high since the Gallup Global Emotions  Report started assessing these experiences in 2006.26  When excluding physical pain and assessing only feel - ings, research finds that all groups report experiencing  negative affect, with women, people with lower than  tertiary education and people who are underemployed  or unemployed reporting higher absolute levels (figure  1.6). Indeed, a trend of increased stress is discernible  across the world and across socioeconomic groups, de - spite volatility from year to year (figure 1.7).27These patterns of high or increasing worry par - allel improvements in some measures of prosperi - ty, such as the global Human Development Index,  which before the Covid-19 pandemic had reached  record highs.28 The human development perspective  can shed light on this seeming puzzle. Human devel - opment is in part about achievements in wellbeing  (in health, education and standards of living), a cru - cial aspect of people’s capabilities: their ability to be  and do what they value and have reason to value. But  chapter 3 considers other aspects of capabilities that  matter beyond wellbeing achievements. Looking be - yond averages, horizontal inequalities in capabilities  across groups  — reflected, say, in gender and racial  discrimination or in dimensions important for life  in the 21st century, including enhanced capabilities  such as higher education and access to broadband29  — persisted and in many cases widened during the  pandemic. And even progress in basic capabilities has stalled  or reversed. The Covid-19 pandemic set back the re - duction in global extreme poverty, disrupting the Figure 1.5 Perceived insecurity is on the rise in most countries, even in some very high Human Development  Index countries 0.400 1.000 0.600 0.800 Human Development Index (HDI) value, 2021Increase in  perceived insecurity Reduction in  perceived insecurityVery high HDI countriesHigh HDI countriesMedium HDI countriesLow HDI countries0.15 0.10 0.05 0 –0.05 –0.10Change in Index of Perceived Human Insecurity valuea Note: Bubble size represents the country population. a.

Over the pandemic’s first  two years an additional 110–150 million people may  have been pushed into extreme poverty, adding to  the 689 million people worldwide forced to survive  on less than $1.90 a day in 2018.30 Even before the pandemic, the pace of poverty reduction was slowing  — from about 1 percentage point a year in 1990–2015  to half a percentage point a year in 2015–2017 . What is more, at least 1.3 billion people live in mul - tidimensional poverty, facing deprivations in dimen - sions important for human development — including Figure 1.6 Negative affect is increasing for everyone, with persistent by inequalities between groups Female Male 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 202115202530354045 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 202115202530354045 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 202115202530354045 Proportion of respondents worldwide experiencing negative aﬀect (%) Tertiary Secondary Elementary Urban Rural Self-employed full timeEmployed part time, does not want full-time employment Employed part time, wants full-time employment (underemployed)Employed full time with an employer Unemployed 15202530354045 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 Note: Negative affect is defined as the aggregate of reported feelings of sadness, anguish, worry and anger in the Gallup Emotions Survey and  excludes reported feelings of physical pain.

Half of them are children.31 And while child mortali - ty has declined globally since 1990, children born in  the world’s poorest countries in the world still have  a 1 in 10 risk of not surviving to their fifth birthday,  whereas almost all children born in some of the rich - est countries survive beyond their fifth birthday.32  The long-term effects of the Covid-19 pandemic  and the current inflation in consumer goods prices  —  especially the increased price of food compounded  by the war in the Ukraine  — threaten to exacerbate the  situation for people living in, or on the brink of, pov - erty across the world.  These deprivations and inequalities in capabilities  pose serious challenges on their own but matter even  more when people try to navigate uncertain times  — and  they matter not only to those excluded and left behind.  Indeed, the feedback loops between pre-existing devel - opment challenges and a novel context of uncertainty  “constitute a systemic challenge to social progress.”33  That provides even more reason to explore why so  many people  — even if they have met their basic needs   — perceive themselves as lacking agency (see chapter 3  for a discussion of agency in the human development framework) as they look to the future. Doing so requires  understanding what is novel about today’s uncertain  times  — the new planetary reality of the Anthropocene,  the unprecedented transition from industrial societies  and the new forms of political polarization. Uncertainty driven by dangerous  planetary change in the Anthropocene Never have so many of the planet’s systems been  knowingly affected by a single species. We humans  are driving climate change34 and harming the integri - ty of many of the ecosystems that sustain human lives  and other species. Our choices are shaping the evolu - tion of life on Earth through legacies that will unfold  over millions of years to come.35 Climate change, biodiversity loss and many other  environmental challenges  — from air pollution to  plastics use  — are receiving individual attention.  But the way these and other planetary pressures are  interlinked  — and the speed, scale and scope of the  unprecedented planetary changes unfolding as a  result — has motivated a new framing of this current  context as the Anthropocene  — the age of humans,  where humans’ impact on the planet is so stark that  it is driving dangerous planetary change  — which has  been formally proposed as a new geological epoch.36 The threats to human lives in the Anthropocene are  fundamentally unequal, as they will more quickly and  intensely affect people and countries that have con - tributed less in relative and absolute terms to plane - tary pressures and benefited less from the changes that  drive planetary pressures. As the 2020 Human Devel - opment Report argued, large and often growing ine - qualities and power imbalances are a defining feature  of the Anthropocene, underpinning the destabilizing  dynamics that divert policy attention and may delay  action to ease planetary pressures. But given that the  threats emanating from dangerous planetary change  are driven mainly by humans, the Anthropocene con - text is creating a responsibility for humanity to act.37 If humans have the power to change the planet in  harmful and unequalizing ways, they have the obli - gation to act towards pursuing a safer and more just  world.38 The responsibility to act falls more heavily  on those who account for more of the planetary pres - sures and have more power to change course. People  are not inherently destroyers of nature; they have Figure 1.7 Stress is high and rising, independent of  education Adult population experiencing stress in the last day, by education level (%) 2005 2010 2015 2020 All groups Less than tertiary educationElementary school or less Tertiary complete45 40 35 30 25 Note: Median values are shown due to inconsistencies in the number of ob - servations across countries and years.

A new planetary reality Uncertainty in the Anthropocene is about much more  than climate change. Even with advances in science  and computational power,40 the multiple feedback  loops between social and ecological systems may  imply that our “knowledge of the world, its ecosys - tems and people, their behaviour, values and choices  will always be partial.”41 One key unknown is wheth - er people will appreciate, and take the responsibility  to act on, the power that we have to stop disrupting  planetary processes. Thus, the Anthropocene is char - acterized by far-reaching and complex interactions  between social and planetary systems that engender  a layer of novel uncertainty.42 Beyond warming temperatures,43 human-induced  planetary pressures result in a natural environment  profoundly different from what humans have pre - viously experienced (spotlight 1.1). The frequency  and intensity of extreme storms, droughts, wildfires  and heatwaves have increased since the 1950s.44  The intensification of urbanization and agricultur - al production has disrupted forests, wetlands and  grasslands  — so much that the amount of human - made materials, such as concrete and asphalt, now  outweigh the Earth’s biomass.45 More than 1  million  species face extinction, threatening the integrity of  whole ecosystems.46 “ The Anthropocene is characterized by  far-reaching and complex interactions  between social and planetary systems that  engender a layer of novel uncertainty These phenomena reinforce each other, magnifying  the speed and scale of threats to our natural and social  systems. For example, the warming and acidification  of oceans provoke migration of fish stocks, affecting  food supplies and the livelihoods of coastal communi - ties. Food insecurity and eroded livelihoods can then  prompt migration, change land uses and exacerbate pollution, further weakening ecosystems.47 As anoth - er example, zoonotic diseases are a latent threat: more  than 10,000 virus species have the potential to infect  humans.48 These have so far been contained within  wild animal populations, but with accelerated climate  change and increased human interference with zo - onotic reservoirs, animal to human transmission is ex - pected to increase49 and heighten the risk of new and  more frequent pandemics.50 For example, the intensi - fied human intervention in animal habitats due to ag - ricultural production is associated with more than half  of all zoonotic diseases infecting humans since 1940.51  And climate change may alter the pattern of disease  exposure and infections as warmer temperatures  change the range of disease-  carrying insects.52 More volatility is also expected. Climate change  is predicted to increase both average temperatures  and temperature variability, with temperature fluctu - ations projected to increase by 100 percent at lower  latitudes.53 More than 40 percent of the world’s pop - ulation depends on water sources affected by high  climate variability. By 2080 an estimated 1 billion  additional people are expected to be impacted by  high climate variability and climate-related water  security threats.54 High weather variability reduces  the “ability of economic agents to plan and function  effectively”55 and may impair health56 and econom - ic productivity.57 For example, intraday and interday  temperature variability is associated with increased  mortality risk.58 Many lower-income countries are  disproportionately exposed to increased temperature  fluctuations and lack resources to invest in adapta - tion, leaving them more vulnerable.59 Dangerous planetary changes are shifting the  baseline of hazards,60 but because these changes are  driven largely by humans, our choices matter. The  uncertainty related to the range of possible evolu - tions in emissions61 is driven by both the evolution of  the climate system and its interaction with the choic - es we make. Implementing the Paris Agreement in a  timely manner increases the world’s chances of keep - ing global average temperature increases below 2°C  (figure 1.8).62 For example, the difference between a  1.5°C and a 2°C increase in global temperature expos - es an extra 1.7 billion people to extreme heatwaves.63 The uncertainty about dangerous planetary change  does not spell unavoidable doom and societal col - lapse.64 A balanced reading of the historical record  CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 35 suggests that human societies have, for the most part,  been resilient, flexible and able to respond, adapt and  thrive when confronting major environmental chang - es (see spotlight 1.1).65 Even though the evidence per - tains to circumscribed geographic contexts, there is  reason to believe that even if not all response options  are fully available  — for instance, migration when  there will be fewer areas with temperatures suitable  for human thriving66 — people retain their ability to  adjust and respond, even to a new planetary reality. Unequal contributions, unequal impacts — planetary  pressures and social imbalances reinforcing each other Countries and groups of people that have contributed  less to planetary pressures are projected to bear the largest burdens of dangerous planetary change.67 For  example, mortality and reductions in labour produc - tivity due to warming temperatures will be greater in  low- and middle-income countries,68 leaving them  with fewer resources to adapt to planetary pressures  and adding layers of vulnerability. Moreover, climate change is an inequality mul - tiplier. Consider the stark inequalities in contribu - tions to and impacts of carbon dioxide emissions.  The top 10 percent of the global income distribution  is responsible for almost half of global annual emis - sions, and the bottom 50 percent, only 12 percent of  emissions.69 The inequalities run even deeper at the  top. In 2019 the bottom 50 percent accounted for  1.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per capita,  while the top 10 percent accounted for 31 tonnes per  capita, the top 0.1 percent 467 tonnes per capita and  Figure 1.8 The wide range of possible future warming depends on our choices 2000 2020 2040 2060 2080 21000.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5 5%–95%Percentiles 17%–83% 33%–67% Median (50%)SSPs 1a APS45 2aSSP1–2.6 SSP1–1.9SSP2–4.5Other comparable studies based on 2030 Nationally Determined Contributions and long-term targetsChange in global mean surface temperature relative to 1850–1900 (ºC) B A APSBA 02040506080100 2.0°C1.5°CExceedance pr obability (%) 2000 2100B AB A 2b2b1b  SSP is Shared Socioeconomic Pathway.

Unmitigated climate  change may drive up to 132 million people into pov - erty in the coming decade.73 Planetary pressures may  also exacerbate horizontal inequalities or even open  new gaps between groups.74 For instance, future risks  of flooding in the United States are expected to affect  mainly low-income Black communities.75 And barri - ers to women’s participation in decisionmaking work  against policies and resource allocations that address  women’s specific vulnerabilities to environmental  change.76 As seen above, curbing emissions at the top of the  income distribution would have a great impact,77 but  when those responsible for planetary pressures are  not equally affected by them and believe they have  the resources to shield themselves from the adverse  effects, incentives to ease planetary pressures are dis - torted. The choices of high-income earners are as - sociated with consumption and production patterns  that account for a disproportionate share of plane - tary pressures. These choices are driven by many fac - tors, but social norms among high-earners and peer  effects influence the lifestyles they expect.78 Their  social context determines not only choices but also  aspirations.79 The channel through which planetary pressures are  affected by inequality runs through actual choices as  well as through aspirations. Aspirations can play an  important role as an incentive for effort with positive  individual and collective outcomes80 and in enhanc - ing human development.81 The reference frames of  aspirations for adjacent, but lower, income groups  are influenced by the behaviour of higher earners. As  reference points change, more and more people may  be influenced to behave in ways that add to planetary  pressures. Such dynamic “expenditure cascades” show how demand for large housing, large cars and  other large goods has increased even where median  incomes are stagnant.82 If access to these position - al goods becomes harder and the referent of aspira - tions is seen to be out of reach, the positive effects of  aspiration can instead lead to alienation and frustra - tion.83 This mismatch between aspiration and reali - zation has implications for people’s wellbeing (it can  increase depression).84 But it can also change people’s  perception of the future from positive to negative and  their sense of agency over the future from high to  low85 — leading to more pessimistic views. As a result,  there will be less of a concern about how individual  behaviour affects future outcomes. And alienation  and frustration can, in turn, contribute to polariza - tion, making collective action towards easing plane - tary pressures more difficult. No second chances: Existential  threats in the Anthropocene To see how the uncertainties in the Anthropocene are  novel, consider existential threats. For the first time  in human history, anthropogenic existential threats  loom larger than those from natural hazards.86 This  started with the advent of nuclear weapons, with  escalating technological power reaching the point  where we are able to threaten our own destruction.  Nuclear war posed an existential risk:87 the perma - nent destruction of humanity’s long-term potential.  Throughout most of human history, the existential  risks to our species emanated exclusively from natu - ral hazards, independent of human action  — including  large asteroid impacts or massive volcanic events,  such as those leading to mass extinction events in  the geological timescale.88 Humans have always had  power to inflict much harm on each other and on na - ture, but only in the Anthropocene have they reached  the potential to kill much of the global population and  destroy the potential of future societies.89 The spectrum of anthropogenic existential threats  is large and growing. In addition to the prospect of  nuclear war, threats include artificial intelligence  (AI), genetic engineering and nanotechnology, as  well as the dangers of planetary pressures and their  interactions.90 They may be deliberate, as in the use  of nuclear force. Or they may be accidental, such as  CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 37 the spread of a virus from a lab, or they may emerge  from ungovernable technological development.91  Heightened political polarization and conflict may  increase the existential threats, including through  nuclear war or biological warfare.92 The drivers of a  possible nuclear conflict may be linked, both in exac - erbating the risks and in magnifying the impacts for  human lives and the planet (spotlight 1.2).93 “ Easing planetary pressures would entail a  fundamental transformation in how societies  live, work and interact with nature. This  transformation engenders its own novel layer  of uncertainty, because, like the Anthropocene  reality, it is unprecedented and uncharted While the existential risks of nuclear war might  be easily imagined, the existential risks of slow-on - set climate change or biodiversity loss may not be  as evident. With continued human pressures on the  planet, tipping points  — beyond return  — can inflict ir - reversible damage to ecosystems and to the benefits  humans derive from them. If tipping points interact,  they may have catastrophic and cascading conse - quences.94 For example, climate change is provoking  Arctic sea-ice loss, which contributes to a slowdown  of the Atlantic circulation, which could disrupt the  West African monsoon and trigger drought in the  Sahel, dry up the Amazon and warm the Southern  Ocean, further accelerating the melting of Antarctic  ice. Amazon forest dieback would distort the stabil - ity of the Earth’s biosphere, with large-scale conse - quences, including massive biodiversity loss and  unprecedented rises in carbon dioxide concentra - tions in the atmosphere.95 While uncertainty remains  about the exact “location” of tipping points and the  full consequences of crossing one, they are just “too  risky to bet against.”96 Realizing the power that humans have over our en - tire planet implies the responsibility to act. Recogniz - ing anthropogenic existential threats also provides an  obligation to lower, indeed to eliminate, existential  risk. In the same way that the Anthropocene provides  a unifying framework to understand how human  choices drive planetary pressures that result in dise - qualizing dangerous planetary change, eliminating  existential risk  — or promoting existential security  —  is the ultimate nonrenewable resource and demands reflecting on the type of institutions needed to reach  existential security (spotlight 1.3). Uncertainty emerges from complex  transitions to ease planetary pressures Adapting to the uncertainty brought about by the An - thropocene reality just described is a tall order. In  addition to adaptation, it is crucial to ease the plan - etary pressures that are driving dangerous planetary  changes. Easing planetary pressures will also mitigate  some of the uncertainties.97 Easing planetary pressures would entail a funda - mental transformation in how societies live, work  and interact with nature, comparable to the transi - tions to agricultural societies and from agricultural  to industrial societies.98 That calls for us to work with   — not against — nature (spotlight 1.4). This transfor - mation engenders its own novel layer of uncertainty,  because, like the Anthropocene reality, it is unprec - edented and uncharted. Uncertainty also emanates  from the fact that transformations involve multiple  social and ecological factors, and their interactions,  playing out over the long term of the transitions at  stake. Even if many of these transitions have in some  ways been charted and modelled (singly or in parts  of the world), there is also modelling and analytical  uncertainty. Central in all this is transforming how societies  generate energy and use materials.99 That will involve  shifting both production and consumption patterns,  underpinned by how human behaviour interacts  with institutions. And that interaction shapes, and is  shaped by, incentives, social norms and values. The 2020 Report proposed representing advancing  human development while easing planetary pressures  as paths taking countries towards the aspirational  space of the green triangle in figure 1.9.100 While the  world had moved in that direction over the past 30  years, it has done so far too slowly and in a way that  leaves higher human development strongly correlat - ed with greater planetary pressures. The needed scale  and speed of this transition should not be oversimpli - fied or minimized, given the ambition of the required  shifts101 — and that, along with complexity of the tran - sition, adds a new layer of uncertainty.102 Transitional uncertainty has several dimensions,  including those associated with a move towards a  38 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 low-carbon economic development path.103 Beyond  the physical uncertainties of climate change are the  uncertainties associated with our deliberate poli - cy choices  — such as altering carbon taxes, shifting  economies away from carbon-intensive industries or  adopting new technologies.104 Some of the uncertainty is associated with who  will win and who will lose as the process unfolds,  which will likely differ across regions and groups  —  recognizing that some are better equipped than oth - ers to benefit from new opportunities.105 One possible  manifestation of uncertainty could be economic inse - curity (spotlight 1.5). For instance, the green econo - my could add more than 24 million jobs worldwide by  2030.106 But these jobs will not necessarily be in the  same regions that stand to lose jobs as fossil fuel in - dustries shut down,107 nor will they require the same  set of skills as in a fossil fuel–based economy. The  economic gains from phasing out coal could amount  to as much as 1.2 percent of global GDP every year until 2100  — but the question remains about how  these gains would be distributed across countries and  across individuals.108 If distributional effects are per - ceived as unfair or if people are left without the sup - port to adapt to a new economic reality, transitions  may be met with resistance, dissent and dispute.109 The outcomes of past transitions have been large - ly unplanned and unintentional. But the expansion of  knowledge and science and our awareness of the An - thropocene reality imply that the transitions to ease  planetary pressures are purposeful and deliberate.  The goal of the transitions is clear  — to move to the as - pirational space of high human development and low  planetary pressures  — even if much uncertainty re - mains about the pathways that would take us there.110 Uncertainties stem not only from the types of pol - icy choices that are adopted but also from how they  are designed and implemented. Success depends on  their perception  — on their social acceptance by dif - ferent segments of the public and those that hold  positions of power. Transitions depend on technol - ogy, and the resulting efficiency gains from it and  how they are distributed. Explored here are chang - es required to ease planetary pressures and the layer  of uncertainty associated with energy and resource  transitions. Energy transitions: Making their way, but  too slowly and amid great uncertainties Energy transitions from fossil fuels towards renewa - bles are driven by new technologies and lower costs.111  While fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas and oil still  produce two-thirds of global electricity,112 renewables  are expected to become the dominant source of glob - al energy supply by 2040.113 But this is only one of  many possible future outcomes. The outcomes vary  widely under three scenarios of the International En - ergy Agency: net-zero emissions, stated policy sce - narios and announced pledges to reduce greenhouse  gas emissions (figure 1.10). Uncertainty can unfold as consequences emerge.  Biofuels, originally thought to be an excellent alterna - tive for fossil fuels, also pose a variety of challenges114  — with implications for land use,115 carbon footprint,116  deforestation impacts,117 biodiversity loss,118 water  competition119 and poverty impacts,120 among others.

CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 39 Uncertainty is also associated with prospects for de - veloping technologies key to the energy transition,  which are not yet in place. Consider energy storage,  which is critical to addressing the intermittency of  supply due to daily and seasonal differences in renew - able power. While a handful of technologies are avail - able, much more is needed to enhance technological  solutions, lower costs and make transmission more ef - ficient. Even with advances in battery storage, adop - tion remains limited in most low- and middle-income  countries due to policy, financial and regulatory bar - riers. Options sought beyond short-term energy stor - age solutions, such as lithium-ion batteries, include  sustainable, cost-efficient long-duration energy stor - age systems, which are a long way off.121 Another dimension of uncertainty is how the fi - nancial system, which assumes a stable climate, will  evolve.122 A shift away from carbon-intensive assets  will expose some investors, who may resist and at - tempt to slow a move towards a low-carbon path.123  Governments are now paying more attention to cli - mate-related financial risks. For example, a 2021 ex - ecutive order by US President Joseph Biden requires  clear and accurate disclosure of climate-related fi - nancial risks to safeguard physical assets as well as  financial markets from climate change–related risks.124 The objective is to protect communities and families  as the United States transitions to the net-zero emis - sions target by 2050. Global and regional mechanisms are also working  to facilitate a low-carbon transition in the financial  sector. The Task Force for Climate-Related Financial  Disclosure seeks to provide investors with informa - tion on climate change–related risks in their portfoli - os. With the same inspiration a consortium of central  banks and financial supervisors established the Net - work for Greening the Financial System.125 The EU  Taxonomy, which classifies environmentally sus - tainable economic activities, supports transitioning  to net-zero emissions by 2050 and implementing  the European Green Deal; the EU Delegated Act has  been formalized to set the screening criteria for the  environmental objectives of new economic activities.  And European countries are stepping up various mit - igation efforts, such as ending the sale of new diesel-  and gas-powered cars in 14 years and imposing tariffs  on goods imported from countries with lax environ - mental laws.126 The volatility in oil and gas prices during the Covid- 19 pandemic and now as the war in Ukraine unfolds  is sending shock waves around the world.127 Oil-   exporting countries experienced large fiscal deficits Figure 1.10 Energy transitions towards renewables can unfold in different ways for different sectors –2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14OtherBuilding sTransportIndus tryElectricity and heatNet zero emissions Announced pledges  to reduce greenhouse  gas emissions  Stated policy scenarios Gigatonnes of carbon dioxide2050 2020 Source: IRENA 2021. 40 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 when oil prices dropped.128 But a range of factors,  including the conflict in Ukraine and economic re - covery as Covid-19 concerns have eased, have led to  a rapid increase in oil prices, a boon to oil-  exporting  countries but also a driver of inflation almost  everywhere.129 The uncertainty associated with energy transi - tions has unsettled people who perceive it as unjust.  French villages and small towns saw protests against  rising petrol prices again in 2021, reminiscent of the  “yellow vest” movements of 2018, Spain saw demon - strations against energy bills and Greece faced social  unrest with the closure of coal mines.130 This even as a  large numbers of jobs are being created in the renew - able energy sector.131 Yet while it is anticipated that  more jobs will be created than lost in energy transi - tions, whether the transitions will be just will depend  on how they are managed.132 Current global pledges to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions cannot safeguard against dangerous cli - mate change.133 Carbon prices remain far too low to  effectively curb emissions. Only 22 percent of global  carbon emissions are under a carbon pricing scheme.134  And implementation remains a challenge even for  commitments made to phase out fossil fuel subsidies   — no date has been set to achieve the target globally,  and 2021 saw the highest increase in fossil fuel sub - sidies since 2010.135 Uncertainty associated with the  transition can be heightened by the realization that  more ambition is needed, along with the resistance  to change from powerful lobby groups or public con - cerns with loss of employment in specific sectors.136  And the transitions can be drawn out: phasing out coal  in Germany, initiated in the 1980s, is still years from  completion, with concerns about stranded assets and  the insecurity of affected workers and communities.137 “ Deliberate energy transitions are  happening now, backed by policies and  supported by social movements Even so, energy transitions are possible.138 A move  in France to increase nuclear capacity boosted its  share of power from 4 percent in 1970 to 40 percent  in 1982.139 The Netherlands went from having coal  supply 55 percent of its power and crude oil 43 per- cent in 1959 to having natural gas supply 50 per- cent by 1971.140 Deliberate energy transitions are happening now, backed by policies and supported by  social movements.141 Uncertainty associated with managing  material use to ease planetary pressures The shift to low-carbon economies will depend in  part on extracting minerals and using materials that  are key to technologies such as electric cars and solar  panels. The same extraction implies land-use change  and emissions that not only add to planetary pres - sures but have also been linked with serious human  rights violations.142 For example, rare earth elements  can be located in sensitive ecosystems with high bio - diversity, crucial carbon sinks and water resources,  which if exploited could irreversibly damage natu - ral resources. Of the 50 million square kilometres of  the Earth’s land currently being mined, about 8 per- cent overlaps with protected areas, 7 percent with key  biodiversity areas and 16 percent with the remaining  areas free of industrial activities and other human  pressures.143 The next wave of renewable energy  growth could affect 30 percent of protected areas and  key biodiversity areas and compromise 60 percent of  the remaining areas free of industrial activities and  other human pressures.144 Ongoing conflict diverts  resources and attention from protecting sensitive  ecosystems and vulnerable populations. With ener - gy demand projections based on existing policies and  policy announcements, mineral demand is expected  to double. And under a sustainable development sce - nario, where energy policies are consistent with the  Paris Agreement goals, mineral demand is expected  to quadruple (figure 1.11).145 Another dimension of uncertainty is related to the  future of seabed and space mining. Growing demand  for renewables is driving mining companies and start - ups to invest in opportunities under the ocean.146 Sci - entists warn that disturbing an otherwise quiet and  dark seabed that provides a unique ecosystem for ma - rine life will have ramifications not only locally but  also thousands of kilometres away. The first experi - ment in seabed mining in 1989, DISCOL,147 demon - strated that species did not recolonize after more than  30 years. With technology ahead of the curve and reg - ulations catching up, the commercial exploitation of  seabed mining could be devastating for marine life.  CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 41 And as technology races ahead to make space min - ing a near possibility, questions are being raised about  regulations.148 There is no legal agreement among  nations to prohibit mining celestial bodies; the two  treaties in place allow for free exploration and use of  space resources, leaving choices to miners. Moreover,  strong pressures to look for answers beyond our own  planet may divert attention from ourselves.149The demand for materials goes beyond that for  the energy transition. It is adding to planetary pres - sures with implications that will span deep into the  future. A plastic water bottle can remain in nature for  approximately 450 years.150 And since the 1950s we  have produced more than 8 billion tonnes of plastic.151  In 2020 the world’s consumption of materials ex - ceeded 100 billion tonnes a year,152 twice the amount Figure 1.11 The energy transition demands minerals and materials that add to planetary pressures 0510152030Millions of tonnesElectricity networks Electric vehicles Hydro Wind Solar photovoltaicsBattery storage 2020 Stated policies Sustainable Development Scenario 010203045 40 35 25 15 5Index (2020 = 1) Lithium Cobalt Manganese Chromium Copper Silicon Graphite Nickel Rare earth elementsMolybdenum Zinc SilverBy technology By mineral25 Note: The demand for minerals will depend on the types of renewable energy. For example, copper and silicon are important for solar panels and  transmitting power, and lithium, manganese and zinc are important for wind energy (IEA 2021b).

To give a  sense of the scale, for the first time in human history,  anthropogenic mass exceeded world’s living biomass  (figure 1.12).156 The challenges with nuclear waste disposal also  point to the need to consider material use in a com - prehensive way. Nuclear resources that are used to  produce clean energy and industrial goods and for  military applications also generate radioactive waste,  which needs to be stored for more than half a million  years  — transmitting responsibilities and challenges to  distant generations.157 Much of the waste is temporar - ily stored underground in tanks, which through wear  and tear may leak radioactive material into our soils  and water. About 95 percent of the world’s nuclear  power reactors have produced an estimated 265,000  metric tonnes of spent heavy-metal fuel and 38 mil- lion cubic metres of solid nuclear waste.158Anthropogenic activities are also disrupting bioge - ochemical cycles. Carbon levels are 36 times higher  than preindustrial levels, phosphorous levels 13 times  higher and nitrogen levels 9 times higher.159 The ni - trogen in fertilizers accumulating in nature pollutes  water (excessive nitrates in drinking water), reduces  air quality, depletes the ozone layer and accelerates  global warming and biodiversity loss.160 The exces - sive runoff of nitrogen into rivers and oceans increas - es algae blooms, which are depleting ocean oxygen  and killing aquatic flora and fauna. Satellite images  suggest that about 1.15 million square kilometres of  the ocean surface may be eutrophic zones,161 with a  large part of them dead zones.162 Rapid technological change: A shifting  ground beneath our feet Rapid technological shifts are bringing new ways for  humans to interact with technology, and with each  Figure 1.12 Anthropogenic mass now exceeds the world’s total living biomass Dry weight (teratonnes) 1.6 Biomass2020±6 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 2020Anthr opogenic  mass1.4 1.2 1.0 0.8 0.6 Other (for example, plastic) Metals Asphalt Bricks Aggr egates (for example, gravel) Concrete0.4 0.2 0 Source: Elhacham and others 2020. CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 43 other, creating more novel uncertainties.163 The po - tential gains are massive, but what about the distri - bution of benefits and the differentiated impacts on  people? The eventual emergence of general-purpose  AI could multiply global GDP per person by a factor  of 10  — something that historically took the world  190 years to accomplish, from 1820 to 2010.164 But  these massive potential aggregate gains may be con - centrated among a few, leaving many behind. One  possibility is falling into a Turing trap, where tech - nological and economic power is concentrated and  translated into political power, “trapping a powerless  majority into an unhappy equilibrium.”165 The back - lash against free trade in some high-income coun - tries offers a cautionary tale, given that the aggregate  income gains of globalization through comparative  advantage and specialization were not distributed to  compensate disadvantaged occupations, sectors or  regions. The economic winners gained power and  lost interest in ensuring the equitable distribution of  benefits.166 “ Recent technological changes outpace our  ability to understand their societal implications.  Often disruptive, artificial intelligence,  social media and other new technologies are  changing our lives in fundamental ways Recent technological changes outpace our ability  to understand their societal implications. Often dis - ruptive, AI, social media and other new technologies  are changing our lives in fundamental ways. To illustrate the novel dimensions of uncertain - ty, the following sections briefly consider the digital  age, AI and genetic editing; see chapters 4 and 5 for  further analysis of the implications of technological  change. The digital world — transforming  human-to-human interaction Less than 1 percent of the world’s technologically  stored information was in a digital format in the late  1980s compared with more than 99 percent by 2012.167  Whether the way we connect to our work, how we  communicate with friends and family or what we do  in our free time, digital technology has become an in - dispensable part of many people’s lives. In 2010 the number of machines connected to the internet ex - ceeded the number of people connected to it for the  first time.168 Unlike any previous generation, many  children born after 2008 have extensive exposure to  digital devices early in life. Tempering the initial optimism about the oppor - tunities of new technologies are downsides or un - intended consequences. Mobile phones trace our  movements. AI, reducing human effort in sophisti - cated tasks, can also replicate and amplify stereo - types. Social media, originally meant to connect us,  are contributing to divisiveness. These illustrate how  new technologies bring along unintended conse - quences, engendering uncertainty.169 Firms are bringing in new technologies at an ac - celerated pace to automate production and reduce  costs. Some jobs are being lost, as in accounting,  administration and translation, just as others are  created in big data, digital security and robotics en - gineering. The World Economic Forum projects that  by 2025, 97 million new jobs will be created and  85 million jobs will be lost across 15 industries in 26  economies.170 Industries not keeping pace with the  trend towards automation stand to lose competitive  edge, as will labourers who do not acquire new skills  to keep pace with the changing labour market. This  may also have implications for low- and middle- income countries, which may see a reshoring of  jobs.171 Digitalization is changing human-to-technology  and human-to-human interactions, sometimes radi - cally. Online dating is one example of digitalization-   altered human interaction.172 Human interaction with algorithms has also turned  detrimental in many ways.173 Mobile telephones and  social media lift the voices of marginalized and op - pressed groups but are also tools for those wishing  to do harm.174 Through these platforms groups with  extremist and violent ideologies can expand their  followings.175 The constant connectedness to social media can  have harmful cognitive and emotional effects.176 Neu - roscientists suggest that internet use has altered  the way the brain functions, affecting attention and  memory and making us less sociable and empathet - ic.177 For example, adding a single moral-emotional  word to a tweet increases its retweet rate by 19  per- cent.178 A post that includes indignant disagreement  44 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 obtains twice as many likes and three times as many  comments.179 And the high demand for attention, as  through the overuse of social media, reduces the time  young people have for constructive reflection, shrink - ing the space for future imagining or reflecting on  personal memories.180 Artificial intelligence — making choices for us As our lives become more dependent on AI — from  weather forecasts to financial market transactions to  analysing DNA  — we are delegating human choices.  AI is choosing the news and information we are ex - posed to and suggesting what we should buy. The use of algorithms in social media results  in people’s decreased exposure to counterattitu - dinal news, facilitating the polarization of views.181  Among millennials in many parts of the world, so - cial media outlets are often the dominant source of  news about politics and governments.182 By recom - mending automated videos and news, manipulative  content now easily reaches viewers, amplifying the  spread of disinformation.183 Social media can also  fuel populist, nationalist and xenophobic waves  across societies.184 AI is getting better at creating counterfeit infor - mation and fuelling the spread of disinformation.  Consider how generative adversarial networks cre - ate counterfeit audios and videos.185 These technol - ogies can now be easily used through apps to create  deepfakes. By 2016 more than 50 percent of inter - net traffic was generated by bots.186 Indeed, false in - formation tends to spread more broadly than true  information.187 Social networks can reduce critical  assessment and facilitate the diffusion of conspiracy  theories. “ As our lives become more dependent on  artificial intelligence  — from weather forecasts  to financial market transactions to analysing  DNA  — we are delegating human choices In a similar vein, who is responsible for mistaken  AI decisions? Credit applications are rejected, and  social media posts are deleted based on AI decisions,  while mechanisms to contest these decisions are not  fully developed. Many algorithms are opaque, unreg - ulated and difficult to contest.188 Pattern-recognition algorithms could be applied to target certain people189  or produce disproportional and biased collateral  damages due to imperfections in the code or in train - ing data.190 The use of AI in the military to deploy  autonomous weapons or killer robots raises many  questions.191 Machine learning is also providing firms with mar - ket information that they have never had before, cre - ating new avenues for advertising while potentially  encroaching on consumer privacy. When consumers  purchase online, they reveal their preferences, and  perhaps information about their friends and families,  that companies can use to expand market outreach.  Such data, often provided inadvertently by consum - ers, may transfer information to companies without  constraints on how it may be used.192 Genomic editing—redefining the  realm of possibilities Genomic editing has revolutionized the life scienc - es and medicine through the possibility of changing  the characteristics of living organisms by altering  DNA. CRISPR can support the treatment of a range  of health conditions with relative ease and efficacy.193  For the first time it is possible to increase the lon - gevity of children with progeria, a genetic disorder  that promotes early aging and to reverse blindness.194  CRISPR is also being explored for neurodegenerative  diseases such as muscular dystrophy, Huntington’s  disease and Alzheimer’s disease.195 Genomic editing also raises questions. Somatic cell  editing can change the genes of a particular patient,  while germline editing of egg and sperm cells can  carry the treatment to future generations. Progress  in this field has been so rapid that issues around eth - ics, regulations and societal implications have coun - tries scrambling to catch up. Recently, a researcher  alarmed the world by confirming that he had edit - ed the genes of twin babies.196 There are also many  safety concerns. For example, in an embryo a nucle - ase may not necessarily cut both copies of the target  genes or may start dividing before the corrections are  complete.197 Gene editing in rats, cattle, sheep and  pigs also shows that it is possible to delete or disable  genes in an embryo. Bioethicists argue that it is im - possible to obtain consent on germline editing from  an embryo or from future generations.198 CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 45 Gene editing in the food industry can enhance  productivity and make products resilient to weather  and disease.199 Japan recently authorized a genetical - ly edited tomato variant rich in amino acids (GABA)  that can induce relaxation and lower blood pressure.200  Drought-resistant crops are being developed to keep  yields high in times of reduced water supply, and re - search is under way on whether genetically edited  rice could be resistant to flooding.201 “ The conjunction of uncertainty and  polarization may be paralyzing  — delaying  action to curb human pressures on the planet How should genetically edited food be regulated  and how should consumers be informed? And what  about the labelling of genetically edited food? Sev - eral biotech companies, agribusinesses and food re - tailers are behind an antilabelling drive, while others  advocate otherwis  e —but until these questions are an - swered, uncertainty is likely to persist.202 Uncertainty propelled by polarization:  Delaying action, adding conflict Uncertainty opens space for dispersing beliefs203 and  disagreeing on best courses of action.204 This is not  necessarily a problem. Indeed, when facing un - predictability, societies tend to leverage aggregate  collective knowledge and narratives to mobilize resil - ience.205 But uncertainty can also spur political polari - zation, especially among those averse to uncertainty.206  For example, research finds that in the uncertain af - termath of a shock, such as a financial crisis, support  for political extremes  increases.207 Political polari - zation reduces generalized trust and divides society  into “us” and “them.” It entrenches opinions, under - mines public deliberation and may even reach toxic  levels, with detrimental effects for democratic free - doms and human rights.208 The last decade has seen rapid democratic backslid - ing and increased political polarization in many socie - ties (see chapter 4).209 Trust and belief in democracy  have been declining in parallel with increasing author - itarianism.210 Political polarization has been increas - ing across a diverse set of countries (figure 1.13). The conjunction of uncertainty and polarization  may be paralyzing — delaying action to curb human pressures on the planet. The real paradox of our time  may be our inability to act, despite mounting evi - dence of the distress that human planetary pressures  are causing our ecological and social systems. But  when perspectives of the future are uncertain, people  may draw different conclusions from the same data,211  and scientific uncertainty can be a basis for political  manipulation.212 Indeed, the spread of disinformation  has been found to contribute to deteriorating social  attitudes and polarization.213 In today’s uncertain times cooperation and dia - logue have often taken a backseat, as armed conflicts  and military spending peak.214 Wars and violent con - flicts pose direct threats to lives and livelihoods and  compounding pre-existing vulnerabilities. They add  huge layers of uncertainty to people’s lives and im - pede both individual and collective investments in  human development.215 The number of people living  in areas affected by violent conflict was reaching re - cord levels even before the war in Ukraine. In 2020  about 1.2 billion people lived within 50 kilometres of  a conflict event, almost half of them (560  million) in  places outside so-called fragile contexts.216 Further - more, a large share of the increase in the number of  people living close to conflict events has occurred in  settings where conflict is present but results in fewer  than 10 fatalities, indicating a shift towards insecu - rity and uncertainty that go beyond the most violent  and deadly conflicts.217 Conflict diverts policy attention and resourc - es from sustainable development and can hamper  climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.218  Studies point to the twin crisis of conflict and plane - tary disruption (spotlight 1.6). Warming temperatures  heighten conflict risks,219 as documented in histo - ry,220 with temperature surges linked to higher crime  and interpersonal violence, even outside armed con - flict settings.221 Nature and natural resources are also  becoming a source of contestation.222 But the links  between climate and conflict are not straightforward   — they span socioeconomic, political and ecological  spheres.223 Today, some of the places most exposed  to climate change coincide with fragile and conflict-   ridden contexts, where resources and the capacity for  resilience are already low (see spotlight 1.6). Conflict  hinders access to much-needed climate financing  in fragile and violent conflict contexts.224 The low-   carbon transitions under way can add insecurity by  46 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 opening new areas of contestation  — especially when  coupled with unequal power dynamics and uncer - tainties about land ownership (spotlight 1.7). And now for something completely  different: Novel and layered  drivers of uncertainty Uncertainties are stacking up and interacting. The  novelty of humans’ stark impact on the planet, the  intentional efforts to transform, the fast pace of tech - nological innovation and human development’s em - beddedness in nature invite us to take a step back and  consider the feedback loops and interlinkages be - tween our social and ecological systems.225 With close  interlinkages threats can easily spill over and multi - ply—leading to systemic failure.226 The interaction  of different layers of uncertainty makes the current  context one of systemwide turbulence.227 Extreme weather and climate events interact in ever more  complex ways, shaped both by physical drivers and by  societal contexts.228 Institutions and behaviours cre - ate nonphysical interconnections, with implications  for the impact of natural hazards and the severity of  future extreme events in a series of complex feedback  loops (table 1.1). These interactions between physical and societal  drivers have always been present at the local level.  But over the 21st century the world will confront a  continuously changing baseline, along with more  extreme wet and dry precipitation events that will  present adaptation challenges far beyond anything  already experienced.229 In fact, the changing “nor - mal” will be so substantial that, if traditional meas - ures to identify extreme events are based on what has  been considered “normal,” the entire late 21st centu - ry would be a single large extreme event.230 In other  words the interaction of physical drivers and societal Figure 1.13 Political polarization is on the rise across the world 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 Political p olarization in 2011Political p olarization in 2021 Eastern Europe and Central Asia Latin America and the Caribbean Middle East and North Africa Sub-Saharan Africa Western Europe and North America Asia and the PaciﬁcBeing placed above the line  means that polarization  increased from 2011 to 2021 Source: Adapted from Boese and others (2022). CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 47 forces231 is fundamentally shifting both the baseline  of hazards and their increased variance.232 In the  past, institutions and behaviours evolved over time  to manage the impact of uncertainty and reduce the  vulnerabilities to threats. In the future, patterns of  local adaption will be so disrupted as a result of cli - mate change233 that we may be ill-equipped to handle  nationally and even globally the simultaneous mate - rialization of multiple threats interacting with one an - other in compounding and novel ways (see box S1.6.1  in spotlight 1.6 for one example of a compounding  crisis at the national level). Droughts have rarely, if ever, affected all the major  food producing regions at the same time, providing  opportunities for “global insurance” through trade.  The decline in food supplies in a drought-affected  region could be compensated for by the supply from  other regions free of drought. Now, the risk of global  crop failure will emerge from more frequent spatially  concurrent heatwaves and droughts affecting major  bread  baskets for wheat, maize and soybean.234 Today,  there is almost zero probability of the four countries  that account for the vast majority of global maize ex - ports suffering simultaneous crop harvest losses great - er than 10 percent. But this probability could increase  to almost 90 percent under global warming of 4°C.235  The global impact runs not only through temperature and changes in hydrological patterns but also through  the large changes in global ecosystem productivity set  in motion by the rise in carbon dioxide levels.236 These risks are compounded by strong pressures  to increase efficiency through powerful economies  of scale in food production, concentrating global  food production in only a few breadbaskets. The ho - mogenization of food consumption habits leaves the  world reliant for nourishment on a limited number of  crops from a limited number of places.237 So, behav - ioural and social choices  — diet choices and economic  incentives to concentrate production  — make us in - creasingly vulnerable to synchronized crop failures.238  Furthermore, the loss of crop diversity could desta - bilize entire ecosystems and have adverse economic  and social impacts.239 Conflict weaves in additional layers of uncertain - ty to the increasingly concentrated and homogenous  global food production. Consider the war in Ukraine,  one of the world’s largest wheat producers and ex - porters. The Russian Federation controls much of the  global market share of fertilizer  — a key input in agri - cultural production. The conflict has disrupted grain  and fertilizer exports, contributing to a commodity  price shock, especially among people living in pover - ty.240 Beyond the battle-related deaths and displace - ments, energy insecurity is looming, a food insecurity Table 1.1 Climate hazards driven by compounded physical drivers and societal context Hazard Climatic drivers Societal drivers Drought Precipitation, evapotranspiration, antecedent soil  moisture, temperatureWater management, land-use change Physiological heat stress Temperature, atmospheric humidity, diurnal cycle Urbanization, irrigation Fire risk Temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind,  lightningUrbanization, deforestation Coastal flooding River flow, precipitation, coastal water level, surge,  wind speedHard infrastructure, removal of natural  coastal barriers Flooding at river confluences Precipitation, river water levels, large-scale  atmospheric circulationWater management, urbanization Concurrent heat and drought Temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration,  atmospheric humidityWater management, soil management,  land-use change Concurrent wind and  precipitation extremesWind speed, precipitation, orography, large-scale  atmospheric circulationFew or none Concurrent heat and air pollution Temperature, solar radiation, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen  oxides, ozone, particulate matterUrbanization, agricultural and  industrial activities Note: The table provides examples of how compounding climatic drivers and societal drivers interact to produce connected climate extremes.

The Covid-19 pandemic brought together zoonot - ic disease, inequalities and global socioecological  connectivity. Unequal labour market conditions im - plied that some workers could quickly transition to  remote working arrangements, safeguarding health  and economic livelihoods, but others had to continue  interacting with people or leave their jobs. And while  social protection may have determined whether a  person had the possibility of forgoing work to follow  public health recommendations, political polariza - tion, misinformation and deteriorating trust in sci - ence and institutions were also at play, influencing  whether people were willing to follow the recommen - dations of public health authorities.242 What the future may hold due to pandemics is a  major source of distress,243 and the Covid-19 pan - demic may leave deep scars. Inequality in access to  digital technologies may have widened education  disparities, setting back children in lower-income  countries.244 While higher-income countries could  mobilize massive resources for recovery spend - ing, often by borrowing at record-low interest rates,  lower-  income countries faced tight fiscal conditions  and had to service debt rather than support people in  dealing with the pandemic’s socioeconomic impacts.  Going forward, the differences in recovery spending  between developed and developing economies may  exacerbate differences in growth trajectories.245 Zoonotic diseases and pandemics may be in the  limelight, but health threats from anthropogenic im - pacts on the planet expand beyond that. Accelerat - ed biodiversity loss is a threat to food security, since  much of our agricultural production depends on pol - linators.246 Food security is a looming global crisis,  with 2.4 billion people facing moderate to severe food  insecurity in 2020. The loss of pollinators also affects  the diversity and availability of different nutrients.247  The loss of biodiversity reduces the potential for new  medical discoveries and poses a direct threat to local  and traditional medicinal practices.248 Pollution is be - coming a major health threat, causing approximately  9 million premature deaths globally in 2015, 92 per- cent of them in low- and middle-income countries.249  Exposure to air pollution has also been linked to high - er Covid-19 mortality.250A mismatch between interacting  uncertainties and resilience strategies The interaction of uncertainties casts doubt on the ef - fectiveness of some of the resilience strategies that  have historically been pursued (see spotlight 1.1).  Leveraging trade to cope with local climate extremes  affecting food production, building temperature-in - different energy systems or migrating may be difficult  amid layered and interacting uncertainties. Where  do we migrate if the entire world is affected by si - multaneous natural hazards  — or when inequalities  and political polarization set up barriers to people’s  movement? Can we diversify food supplies through  imports in a world where increasing temperatures  heighten the risk of simultaneous failures of wheat,  maize and soybean harvests251 or where pandemic-in - duced labour shortages, war and geopolitical ten - sions weaken global supply chains?252 “ The interaction of uncertainties casts  doubt on the effectiveness of some of the  resilience strategies that have historically  been pursued. Where do we migrate if the  entire world is affected by natural hazards  — or  when inequalities and political polarization  set up barriers to people’s movement? Our common aspirations, as codified in the 2030  Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Uni - versal Declaration of Human Rights, are indivisible.  Today, many people are losing faith in our collective  ability to meet them.253 Indeed, democratic practices  have been weakening,254 and the inability of coun - tries to come together quickly enough during the  Covid-19 crisis to provide equitable vaccine access,  another illustration.255 UN Secretary-General Antó - nio Guterres has warned repeatedly of a fraying glob - al world order256 and has called on nations to rebuild  global solidarity and multilateral cooperation in the  face of systemic and interconnected threats.257 To meet the “confluence of calamities”258 in the  world today, we need more international cooper - ation, not less, and more solidarity across people,  across generations and with the planet. A main chal - lenge to overcome is that action to ease planetary  pressures is needed now, but some of the benefits will  not materialize until well in the future. Insights from  CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 49 indigenous philosophies bridge these intergenera - tional gaps and may contribute to foster change. In  many of these philosophies, past, present and future  generations share “interwoven histories that shape  […] collective lives and the world” and intergenera - tional responsibilities of “socioenvironmental guardi - anship” are implied.259 Restoring our connection with  the planet and with ourselves, including across gen - erations, and acting in ways that enhance our shared,  intergenerational, collective lives then become  central objectives. Yet these perspectives are often  marginalized in mainstream policy debates, mak - ing the empowerment of indigenous and other mar - ginalized communities not only a matter of justice  but also a matter of gaining insights and ideas that  could benefit humanity as a whole (spotlight 1.8).260 Where we go from here is up to us: will we act  in time to avoid the worst consequences, or will polarization drive disagreement and hinder change?  Will we address the power imbalances and inequal - ities that drive planetary pressures and obstruct  people’s agency? Will the actions taken be enough,  and will they benefit everyone, or will they exac - erbate inequalities, adding strain to already weak - ened social contracts and global cooperation? The  uncertainty complex we face may seem daunting,  but history provides ample evidence of individual  and societal resilience. Inaction in the face of deep  uncertainty and compounding threats to human  development is not an option. Going forward, we  need to be courageous enough to challenge the sta - tus quo and to look into new places, new people  and a diverse set of knowledge traditions for inspi - ration and solutions.261 Indeed, human agency can  be a major driver of large-scale societal change (see  chapter 3). 50 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 Today’s climate crisis has no precedent in Earth’s  history, owing to the combination of its speed, even - tual magnitude, global scale and human cause. Yet  regional and even global climates have changed  profoundly and often abruptly over the roughly  300,000-year history of humanity.1 Anthropologists,  archaeologists, economists, geneticists, geographers,  historians, linguists and paleo scientists have long  attempted to identify how these changes influenced  communities and societies. Scholars in this field  —  recently termed the history of climate and society  (HCS) — typically identify relationships between cli - matic and human histories not only to improve un - derstandings of the past but also to inform forecasts  of the hotter future.2 For over a century the most influential studies in  HCS argued that temperature and precipitation trends  and anomalies caused human populations to either  collapse or undergo subsistence crises. While HCS  scholars have not settled on a common, cross-dis - ciplinary definition of collapse, to them the concept  usually involves a disintegration of socioeconomic  complexity, leading to depopulation, new political  structures and new settlement patterns. HCS scholars  have used statistical and qualitative methods to link  drought and cooling to the collapse of, for example: • The Akkadian Empire in the 3rd millennium BCE. • The societies of the Bronze Age Mediterranean in  the 2nd millennium BCE. • The Western Roman Empire in the 5th and 6th  centuries CE. • The cities of the Classical Maya in the 10th century  CE. • Angkor, capital of the Khmer Empire, in the 15th  century CE. • The Norse settlements of western Greenland in the  15th century CE.3 When examining well-documented and often  comparatively recent periods and places, HCS schol - ars usually concentrate on subsistence crises that culminated in political transformation but not col - lapse. In such studies crises typically afflicted only  one state  — for example, during dynastic transitions  in ancient Egypt or Imperial China — but occasionally  also entire continents, in western Eurasia during the  14th or 17th century, for instance. In this scholarship  the worst-affected civilizations were those with sub - sistence strategies, hydraulic infrastructure, military  and demographic pressures, or inefficient and unpop - ular governments that left them vulnerable to envi - ronmental disruption.4 HCS studies of collapse and crisis inform common  fears that present-day civilizations cannot survive  continued global warming.5 Today’s climate change  will indeed reduce agricultural productivity; limit  the availability of freshwater; increase the severity of  droughts, heat waves and tropical cyclones; and re - shape coastal environments on a speed and scale that  could provoke destabilizing societal responses.6 Yet  the disproportionate emphasis on collapse and crisis  in HCS scholarship partly reflects systematic biases in  how studies in the field are designed, rather than the  most common historical responses to climate change.7 HCS scholars are increasingly exploring the re - silience of past populations to climatic changes and  anomalies. Definitions of resilience in climate-related  fields long privileged “bouncing back” in the wake of  disaster and were eventually criticized for assuming  that social change is inherently undesirable. Critics  argued moreover that the concept distracted from  the more urgent priority of mitigating human green - house gas emissions. They claimed that focusing on  resilience encouraged the assumption that disasters  are inevitable  — naturalizing sources of vulnerability  in marginalized populations  — and that it displaced re - sponsibility for avoiding disaster from governments  to individuals.8 Yet people of the past plainly found ways to cope  with climate changes, and there is no term as accessi - ble as resilience to describe their achievements. Nor SPOTLIGHT 1.1 Beyond crisis and collapse:  Climate change in human history Dagomar Degroot,  Georgetown University 51 CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX is there any doubt that governments must foster re - silience to the human-caused warming that is already  baked into the current climate crisis. Today, the Inter - governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) uses  the term resilience to mean the ability of coupled  human and natural systems “to cope with a hazardous  event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorgan - izing in ways that maintain their essential function,  identity and structure.”9 It therefore encompasses  adaptation, which the IPCC defines as the “process  of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its ef - fects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial  opportunities.”10 Neither adaptation nor resilience is  automatically a positive quality. Both may preserve  unjust systems and come at the expense of vulnerable  populations. In particular, the resilience of a society,  government, institution or culture across decades or  centuries may belie the vulnerability of ordinary peo - ple to extreme weather.11 Scholars in different disciplines have attempted to  identify historical examples of resilience in diverse  ways. Archaeologists, for example, have perhaps  overstressed “adaptionist” understandings of past  responses to climate change. Many have defined re - silience using resilience theory, a method based on  the adaptive cycle model, in which social-ecological  systems gradually lose resilience as they grow in size  and complexity, then regain it after they collapse.  Yet today there is widespread disagreement over  how  — and whether  — to use resilience theory. Inter - disciplinary collaborations therefore typically use  broad conceptualizations of resilience, most of which  roughly align with the IPCC’s definition.12 One recent approach is to identify common path - ways followed by populations that were broadly re - silient in the face of past climate changes  — meaning  that they avoided serious or sustained demographic  loss. This approach can emphasize both the diversi - ty of resilient responses to past climate changes and  the existence of shared strategies that may inform  present-day climate policy.13 There are at least five of  these pathways (figure S1.1.1): • Identifying new opportunities in local and regional  environments. • Maintaining or developing resilient energy systems. • Exploiting diverse resources through trade. • Adapting institutions to new climatic risks. • Migrating to new environments.Populations that followed the first pathway ex - ploited regional or local environments that respond - ed to global or hemispheric climate changes in ways  that benefitted how these populations had organ - ized their societies. The most striking examples  date back to the Pleistocene, the geological epoch  in which cycles in Earth’s orbit and rotation repeat - edly altered greenhouse gas concentrations enough  to trigger alternating glacial and interglacial peri - ods. In glacial periods advancing ice sheets trapped  water previously in the oceans, lowering sea levels  and creating land bridges that humans exploited to  migrate across the Earth. The same forces responsi - ble for glacial and interglacial periods also strength - ened monsoon systems, periodically “greening” the  Sahara and helping pastoralists migrate through and  thrive in what is now the world’s largest desert. Pas - toralists, in turn, may have delayed the redesertifi - cation of parts of the Sahara by sustaining healthy  grassland ecosystems.14 Well into the Holocene, the recent geological  epoch characterized by a relatively stable intergla - cial climate, similar dynamics played out across  smaller scales in time and space. In the Eastern Med - iterranean precipitation increased during winter, the  region’s wet season, during the 6th century CE. Pas - toral and agricultural communities benefitted from  higher rainfall because the taxation system of the  Eastern Mediterranean allowed them to easily trans - port agricultural commodities to population centres.  Rising productivity encouraged elites to invest in  market-oriented agriculture; new dams, channels,  pools and other infrastructure then allowed farmers  to manage water more effectively.15 The second pathway involved developing or ex - ploiting energy systems for transportation, industry  and human subsistence that did not respond directly  to shifts in temperature or precipitation. As Europe - an temperatures declined in the 6th century, com - munities in Frisia (in today’s northern Netherlands)  thrived by consuming dairy and meat from livestock,  supplemented by fish, shellfish and waterfowl. This  subsistence strategy was less sensitive to cooling than  others in Europe, many of which depended on culti - vating grains that were sensitive to variations in tem - perature.16 In the same century subsistence strategies  across much of Finland and in northern Sweden and  Norway did not depend on crop cultivation and in  52 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 fact primarily exploited wild food resources such as  birds, freshwater fish, seals and terrestrial mammals.  Changes in temperature affected the availability and  accessibility of these resources in diverse ways.17 In Kraków, Poland, firewood prices rose as win - ter temperatures declined in the 17th, 18th and 19th  centuries. Because the city occupied an increasingly  peripheral position within larger polities, state au - thorities did not act to relieve high fuel prices. The  city’s inhabitants therefore shifted decisively from  wood to coal for heating. Coal was more reliable and  less expensive than firewood  — and therefore benefi - cial for household budgets.18To follow the third pathway, populations exploited  the benefits of trade  — including trade within imperial  borders  — to cope with climate change. Weather rarely  affected far-flung regions simultaneously or equally.  Trade therefore allowed populations to thrive despite  climatic anomalies by importing commodities that  were less available locally, owing in part to extreme  weather. The integration of European and then glob - al grain markets in the 2nd millennium CE eventually  buffered populations at the centre of trading networks  from increases in food prices that were influenced by  precipitation or temperature anomalies.19 At the same  time these networks could render populations on Figure S1.1.1 The five pathways to resilience A means of building resilience  by adjusting to actual or  expected climate and its eﬀects  in order to moderate harm or  exploit beneﬁcial opportunitiesThe ability of societies to cope  with a hazardous event, trend  or disturbance, responding or  reorganizing in ways that  maintain their essential  function, identity and structure Exploiting  new  opportunitiesResilient  energy  systemResources  of trade  and empirePolitical and institutional  adaptationsMigration  and  transformation Resilience AdaptationCLIMATE PRESSURES Note: The definition of resilience and adaptation are based on IPCC (2022a).

In the late 19th century millions died when econom - ic and political priorities led British governments to  demand grain exports from colonized India, despite  local droughts.20 Some populations coped with climatic variability  and change by inventing technologies and exploit - ing commodities that opened new possibilities for  trade. When droughts and periods of high precipi - tation alternated in southeastern California in the  15th century, Mojava settlements developed new ce - ramic technologies and basket-making techniques  to establish trade networks centred on maize, beans  and squash produced by nearby Kwatsáan communi - ties.21 These networks fostered the expansion of a dy - namic “dream culture” that further elevated Mojave  long-distance trading. Dreams that successfully di - rected Mojaves towards prosperity or military victory  rewarded leaders with political power, while dreams  that resulted in failure undermined the individual  leaders who shared them. The result was a more mo - bile, seasonally oriented and interregional economy  that could better cope with climatic variability.22 The fourth pathway involved deliberate political  and institutional adaptations that fostered resilience  to weather extremes. Italian city-states responded  to agricultural disruptions worsened by 13th century  cooling by securing new food imports, setting restric - tions on grain prices, providing grain subsidies and  banning grain exports. Cooling across Europe in the  final decades of the 17th century reduced grain yields  and tax revenues across France just as grain supplies  were already strained by military provisions. French  administrators struggled to respond effectively, and  harvest failures in 1693 and 1694 led to catastroph - ic famines.23 When similar conditions returned in  1709, however, administrators negotiated emergency  grain imports from Algeria that effectively eased food  shortages.24 Finally, populations took the fifth pathway by mi - grating to either escape or exploit the impacts of cli - mate change in local environments. Climate refugees  migrating to escape the desertification of the east - ern Sahara likely helped establish Pharaonic Egypt.25  Across Eurasia, pastoral societies later threatened  agrarian empires when precipitation changes ei - ther allowed them to rear more horses or threatened  grasslands that otherwise sustained them. Some migrations by pastoralists responded to subsistence  crises  — and thus political and military vulnerability  —  within agrarian empires. Jurchen raids, for instance,  exploited destabilizing droughts in 17th century  China to establish the Qing Dynasty.26 Populations often pursued multiple pathways at  the same time, and different communities in soci - eties could follow distinct pathways. Populations  may also have benefitted from additional pathways  to endure or exploit climate changes. For example,  resilient populations may have enjoyed low socio - economic inequality or effective means of providing  life’s necessities for their poorest members. A robust  culture of civic charity in Dutch coastal cities helped  insulate the 16th and 17th century Dutch Repub - lic from famines that affected primarily poor people  in other parts of Europe.27 Similarly, the population  of Tokugawa Japan soared during periods of severe  17th century cooling partly because wealthy farm - ers were expected to provide for poor people.28 Ad - ditional pathways may have been adaptive for some  communities but maladaptive for others. Capital-in - tensive hydraulic infrastructure likely increased the  vulnerability to drought of polities in South America,  Egypt, Mesopotamia and Cambodia, all of which de - pended on canals for irrigation, but provided drain - age and transportation opportunities in coastal areas  of the present-day Netherlands and thereby stimu - lated the development of greater wealth and military  potential.29 What, then, can policymakers learn from the di - verse experiences of climate change in the past to  build resilience to today’s human-caused warming?  One lesson may be that the impacts of climate change  on populations were and are determined as much by  human socioeconomic, cultural and political arrange - ments as the magnitude of environmental transfor - mations. Communities, therefore, are rarely doomed  to a particular fate; under all but the most extreme  emissions scenarios, substantial scope remains for  human adaptation and prosperity. More specifically, the past reveals that adaptations  to build resilience may involve identifying and ex - ploiting what rare opportunities warming may pro - vide, developing energy systems that both mitigate  emissions and are resilient to extreme weather, diver - sifying sources of energy and commodities, restoring  or maintaining flexible political and legal systems  54 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 NOTES 1 Osman and others 2021; Tierney and others 2020. 2 Degroot and others 2021. 3 See, for example, Brooke (2015) and Weiss (2017). 4 See, for instance, Campbell (2016) and Parker (2013). 5 See, for example, Begley (2021). 6 IPCC 2021. 7 Degroot and others 2021. 8 Soens 2020. 9 IPCC 2022a. 10 IPCC 2022a. 11 Izdebski, Mordechai and White 2018; Soens 2018; Van Bavel and others  2020. 12 Bradtmöller, Grimm and Riel-Salvatore 2017; Riede 2008. 13 Degroot and others 2021. 14 Brierley, Manning and Maslin 2018; Claussen, Dallmeyer and Bader 2017;  Timmermann and Friedrich 2016. 15 Decker 2009; Izdebski and others 2016.16 Devroey 2003; Knol and Ijssennagger 2017; Vos 2015. 17 Oinonen and others 2020; Tvauri 2014. 18 Miodunka 2020. 19 Epstein 2006. 20 Davis 2002. 21 Anderson 2005. 22 Zappia 2014. 23 Berger 1976; Lachvier 1991; Campbell and others 2017; Guillet and others  2017; Lavigne and others 2013. 24 Goubert 1982. 25 Lieberman and Gordon 2018. 26 Brook 2010; Cui and others 2019. 27 Curtis and Dijkman 2019. 28 Parker 2013. 29 Buckley and others 2010; Degroot 2018; de Souza and others 2019; Gill  2000; Manning and others 2017.that prioritize redundancies over efficiencies and nor - malizing climate migration. The past may also reveal  that tackling inequality and poverty  — in particular,  through policies that further environmental justice  for historically marginalized populations  — will foster  resilience to global warming. And it may indicate that capital-intensive interventions to adapt to climate  change have the potential to become sources of vul - nerability. More HCS scholarship will further clarify  the lessons of the past, lessons that may offer compel - ling reasons for hope and suggest strategies for sus - tainable human development in the decades to come. CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 55 When Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer coined  the term Anthropocene in 2000 to denote an epoch  characterized by the geological impact of the human  species on planet Earth, these effects were already  evident.1 Since then, geologists and other scientists  have debated the starting point of the Anthropo - cene. Among the contenders is the dispersion of ra - dioactive isotopes from widespread nuclear testing  during the 1950s  — an indicator also singled out by  the Anthropocene Working Group under the Inter - national Commission on Stratigraphy.2 Meanwhile,  the Anthropocene has become both a ubiquitous  scientific concept and a potent political symbol that  extends to the Earth’s climate and ecosystems. As  a result, questions of extinction and survival loom  large in political debates about human development  in this new epoch. Such debates echo those around  the Cold War nuclear arms race, and there are good  reasons for scrutinizing the intellectual and political  links between the nuclear age and the current predic - ament. Indeed, a closer examination of the nuclear–   environment nexus offers a prescient perspective on  the persistent links between militarization and an - thropogenic reconfigurations of the planet. Historically, the connections between nuclear  weapons and the environment are both multiple and  deep. That nature could be controlled and manipulat - ed was an integral part of the notion of security dur - ing the Cold War. The postwar development of such  scientific disciplines as meteorology, glaciology and  oceanography took place in a close relationship with  the preparations for nuclear war, since adequate un - derstanding of the effects of these weapons  — vital  for strategy and defence  — depended on ecologi - cal knowledge. Over time these branches of science  produced a new understanding of the Earth and its  interacting systems, which in turn fostered concep - tions of security as common and tied to the natural  environment.Nuclear testing and uncertainties about the effects  of radioactive fallout gave rise to scientific measure - ments and environmental concerns, entanglements  that persist to this day in climate modelling.3 Anti - nuclear activists and movements unrelentingly criti - cized the arms race and the attendant risks of nuclear  deterrence while exploiting scientific uncertainty  and disagreement to expand political responsibility  in time and space. Temporally, the effects of nucle - ar weapons revolved around future generations. And  spatially, the effects transgressed any ground zero  and came to include concern for both humanity and  the planet, later symbolized in iconic photos of a liv - ing yet fragile Earth taken from space. The nuclear  arms race paradoxically sparked a more ecocentric  conception of the environment.4 The 1980s, when détente had given way to the  second Cold War, witnessed an intensification and  emerging synthesis of such links, especially striking  in the work of Jonathan Schell, author of the best - selling The Fate of the Earth  (1982).5 The book, which  compels people to imagine the extinction of the  human species as a way of cultivating a global eco - logical awareness that included the fate of future gen - erations, played a central role in the “nuclear freeze”  movement and primed the public for debates about  nuclear winter. Drawing on the latest insights from  Earth system science, Schell concluded that the en - vironmental effects of nuclear war would most likely  leave Earth uninhabitable for humans. The political  lesson taught by science was clear: the survival of  the human species depended on functioning Earth  systems and had to be seen in a broader ecological  framework. To Schell, nuclear weapons symbolized  not only modernity’s inability to recognize its own  self-destructiveness but also a hubris in humans’  belief that the threat to complex, fragile and highly  interdependent ecosystems could be rationally man - aged and contained.6SPOTLIGHT 1.2 The nuclear–environment nexus and human  development in the Anthropocene Rens van Munster,  Danish Institute for International Studies, and Casper Sylvest,  University of Southern Denmark,  Department of History 56 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 After the turn of the millennium, Schell’s under - standing of the entanglements between nuclear  weapons and climate issues led him to recognize the  value of the Anthropocene as an idea that explicitly  foregrounds the connections between Western mo - dernity and human technological prowess on the  one hand and climate change, species extinction and  biodiversity loss on the other. To Schell the Anthro - pocene called for reflecting more deeply on human– Earth relations and expanding the conventional  horizons of space, time, community and agency. Yet,  valuing ourselves as humans in relation to nature and  other forms of life involves a heavy ethical and po - litical responsibility, and Schell clearly feared that  humans were not up to the task at a time when their  technological power forcefully set the species apart  from the rest of creation. Ultimately, however, Schell  insisted on the role of human beings as “chief valuer”  and maintained that a true embrace of this responsi - bility would decentre the human, whether by install - ing sober lessons about humility, prudence and the  limits of a narrow technological rationality or by pro - moting more ecocentric valuations of the world, as expressed in ideas about interspecies entanglements,  companionship and “nature-based” solutions to cli - mate change.7 Schell’s work is a reminder of the deep relation - ship between nuclear weapons and the environment  in the Anthropocene. Nuclear weapons are detri - mental to human development and risk jeopardiz - ing the ecological systems on which it depends. The  vast economic resources required for the produc - tion, maintenance and stockpiling of nuclear weap - ons divert funds away from human development  and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.  Nuclear war would also have grave humanitarian  consequences, including large-scale displacements,  long-term harm to human health, restricted access to  food and catastrophic damage to the environment.  Some scientists predict that even a limited nuclear  war could set off a global nuclear winter.8 In a nucle - ar-armed world survivability and sustainability are  tightly entwined.

CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 57 Humanity has faced many natural existential risks  over the 3,000 centuries we have survived so far  —  such as risks from asteroid impacts or supervolcanic  eruptions. But the anthropogenic risks we now face  appear much greater in probability and continue to  rise as our power over the world grows ever greater.1  It is unclear whether we can survive another three  centuries, let alone three thousand. To survive, we need to achieve two things. We must  first bring the current level of existential risk down  —  putting out the fires we already face from the threat  of nuclear war and climate change. But we cannot al - ways be fighting fires. A defining feature of existen - tial risk is that there are no second chances  — a single  existential catastrophe would be our permanent un - doing. So we must also create the equivalent of fire  brigades and fire-safety codes  — making institutional  changes to ensure that existential risk (including that  from new technologies and developments) stays low  forever. If we can achieve both these things, we will have  reached existential security: a return to comparative  safety, where we have ended the era of heightened  risk to humanity.2 This would be no utopia. Existen - tial security would not guarantee universal human  development or freedom  — or health and prosperi - ty. But it would be necessary to achieve any of those  things  — a foundation on which they rest. One way to look at our current position is that hu - manity faces a high and unsustainable level of risk.  Indeed, we can see this as one of the most fundamen - tal kinds of sustainability. Think of the probability  that humanity will continue to survive and flourish  over a time span comparable with the 3,000 centu - ries we have lived so far. Each year that our time of  heightened risk goes on, this probability of a success - ful future drops. And nothing we ever do could restore  that chance. The probability of humanity surviving to  live out its potential is the ultimate nonrenewable re - source: something we depend on completely  — with no possible substitutes  — but are frittering away. Exis - tential security means stabilizing humanity’s survival  curve  — greatly reducing the risk and ensuring that it  stays low. Only by doing so can we keep the probabili - ty of long-term survival high (figure S1.3.1). What would be required to stem this loss  — to reach  existential security? A large part of the answer has to come from inter - national institutions. Existential security is inher - ently international: the risks that could destroy us  transcend national boundaries, and finding ways  forward that never once succumb to an existential  catastrophe will require international coordination.  Meeting this challenge would be an extremely diffi - cult but necessary task. Here are some broad outlines  of what it would require. As Carl Sagan wrote: “The world-altering powers  that technology has delivered into our hands now re - quire a degree of consideration and foresight that has  never before been asked of us.”3 We need the fore - sight to see the risks while they are still on the hori - zon, providing time to steer around them or, if that  is impossible, to prepare to meet them. This involves  knowing how to ask the right questions about future  dangers. And while being able to accurately answer  such questions is impossible, great progress is being  made in systematically assigning well-calibrated and  accurate probabilities to them.4 An institution aimed  at existential security would need to harness this pro - gress and be at the forefront of forecasting expertise. It would also require extremely high trust: from  both the public and the elites across many different  nation states. Perhaps it could learn from the Inter - governmental Panel on Climate Change, with its  attempts to neutrally establish the current state of  scientific consensus on climate change in a transpar - ent manner, with input from all nations. An institution for existential security would need  extremely strong coordinating ability. Because exis - tential risk threatens a common foundation on which SPOTLIGHT 1.3 What kind of institution is needed for existential security? Toby Ord,  Senior Research Fellow, The Future of Humanity Institute, University of Oxford, United Kingdom 58 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 all of our varied hopes and futures are built, it is in  every nation’s interest to avoid it. But because differ - ent strategies and tactics for avoiding risk will have  burdens that fall unevenly upon the nations, there are  still great challenges for coordinating a path forward  that everyone can accept. Finally, such an institution would require a great  deal of buy-in. This would have to be both strong and  lasting. Strong buy-in would be required before the idea of  an institution to govern existential risks could even  get off the ground, as nations will not lightly make  the sacrifices in sovereignty that would be required.  While there is not sufficient buy-in at the moment,  this may change over years or decades as people  slowly face up to the gravity of the threats facing hu - manity. And just as the United Nations was formed  in the wake of the crisis and catastrophe of the Sec - ond World War, in the wake of new global crises and threats, the idea of new institutions with the power to  achieve existential security may move quickly from  unthinkable to inevitable. Our resolve would have to be lasting. National  constitutions provide proof that building institution - al constraints that last hundreds of years is possible.  Designing a constitution means setting in place the  parameters for our descendants to operate across  generations  — as well as the means to adjust those  parameters if circumstances change in unforeseen  ways. Building institutions to reach existential secu - rity would have much in common with formulating a  constitution  — not just for a nation, but for humanity,  and with a focus on ensuring that each generation co - operates to give succeeding generations the chance  the exist and flourish in their turn.

CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 59 People–planet interactions underpin many of the di - verse capacities required to embrace uncertainty, to  navigate and respond to the complex dynamics of the  Anthropocene. The diversity of life on Earth and all  the myriad functions, connections and interactions  we have with it provides short-term and long-term ca - pacity for life (including human life) to persist under  and adapt to sudden and gradual changes of the An - thropocene. As dominant models of development  —  with their emphasis on industrialization, resource  exploitation and urbanization  — continue to erode  biodiversity and human interactions with it, we  lose options and opportunities, reducing flexibili - ty and adaptive capacity. Worryingly, these declines  further push other planetary pressures such as cli - mate change and pollution ever closer to dangerous  thresholds.1 A focus on human–nature relationships and trans - formative capacities moves away from the risk reduc - tion approaches that have become dominant as ways  to manage uncertainty but that often fail to address  the complex causes of planetary pressures and ine - quality.2 Instead, by foregrounding on relationships,  policy can overcome problematic divisions between  nature and development to focus on the quality of  relationships connecting people and planet and on  reconfiguring relationships to enhance capacities to  navigate uncertain futures.3 For example, new indica - tors emerging from indigenous community monitor - ing systems feature relationships connecting people  and nature, such as indicators of the condition of  the human–biodiversity relationship4 and indicators  that monitor relationships and feedbacks between  the social and ecological components of a place.5  Such monitoring systems do not treat the social and  ecological parts as separable. They focus instead on  what connects them and could prove a valuable way  forward for more integrated approaches to assessing  human development progress.Recognizing people–planet relationships widens  the focus of policy from the local level to take into ac - count the globally intertwined social-ecological sys - tems of the Anthropocene. An increase in planetary  pressures in one part of the world ripples across re - gions, with material and other less tangible impacts  on distant places and groups, as the Covid-19 pan - demic has so graphically highlighted. The Anthro - pocene is a heightened state of interconnectedness  where social-ecological teleconnections and power  asymmetries in global systems require new forms of  solidarity for the interdependencies and realities of  the Anthropocene.6 Transitions in one country from  nonrenewable energy sources (fossil fuels) towards  renewable energy (solar) — done in solidarity with  groups and places where the mineral resources (co - balt or lithium) for these technologies reside  — will  likely have very different outcomes for human devel - opment from local transitions that do not account for  such distant impacts and dynamics.7 Inclusion and participation, so central to the human  development journey, can also have blind spots. Fo - cusing on people–planet relationships highlights ad - ditional barriers and potentially new dimensions of  inclusiveness. It opens avenues to explore moral or  ethical questions around including nonhuman enti - ties and the risks and impacts imposed on those en - tities through various policy choices. This expansion  of care and concern in human development is a lively  topic receiving increasing attention as the intercon - nection and impact of our relationship with the natu - ral world becomes more apparent.8 It is strengthened  as development policy engages more deeply with  multiple knowledge and value systems that reject the  separation of human and nonhuman or of nature and  people. Biocultural approaches, for example, portray  human livelihoods, landscapes and ecosystems  as having coevolved over long periods of time. SPOTLIGHT 1.4 People–planet relationships in an  uncertain, unsettled world Belinda Reyers,  University of Pretoria and Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics of the Royal Swedish Academy  of Sciences 60 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 Biocultural diversity is the “diversity of life in all its  manifestations  — biological, cultural, and linguistic   — which are interrelated within a complex socio - ecological adaptive system.”9 Taking into account the dynamics of the Anthropo - cene, where complex social-ecological interactions  result in lag effects and where today’s choices are  committing the planet to global-scale changes that  will span thousands of years,10 it becomes apparent  that inclusion and participation have an important  temporal dimension and that policy must innovate  to include young people and consider future gener - ations whose realities are being shaped for the long  term by actions and choices taken today. Innovation and human development have long  gone hand in hand. In the context of the Anthropo - cene, there is, however, a risk that many of the in - novative policies, practices and interventions that  exist and are emerging will all stay small, localized  and short term  — tinkering at the edges without fun - damentally rewiring development models and ap - proaches to truly contend with the Anthropocene,  the scale of its planetary pressures and the economic  and political systems and asymmetries on which it is  based.11 Innovations that do not consider what needs  to be built up and broken down, what needs protec - tion and how to manage power asymmetries and par - ticipation can end up increasing vulnerability and  eroding sustainability and resilience.12 Substituting one innovation (such as fossil fuel)  with another (such as renewable energy) without ad - dressing justice and sustainability of the transition  will reduce emissions but will also likely defer many other impacts and risks to another place, group and  time, without necessarily improving energy access  and democracy.13 As the 2020 Human Development  Report made clear: “We must reorient our approach  from solving discrete siloed problems to navigating  multidimensional, interconnected and increasingly  universal predicaments.”14 By anchoring innovation  in deliberate considerations of people–planet rela - tionships, the interconnections and interdependen - cies become clear and offer novel opportunities for  human development in an uncertain future.15 These  interdependencies are not only material flows of en - ergy, resources and waste; they are also intangible  but essential in how they shape identities, cultures,  relationships, minds, mental and physical wellbeing,  and ultimately freedoms and choices in ways we  often realize only when lost.16 Without acknowledging these relationships in the  human development journey, dangerous feedbacks  and negative people–planet relationships will under - mine human development gains.17 Previous inno - vations that have ignored these relationships to the  detriment of the environment, vulnerable groups,  local adaptive capacities and cultural practices are  legion.18 On the other hand, research exploring per - sistent poverty traps that considers social-ecological  interactions highlights not only important causes of  these traps but also novel pathways out of poverty.19  As Michele-Lee Moore and colleagues point out, it  is “the capacity to see, interrogate, and reimagine”  these people–planet relationships that will create the  disruptive and radical changes needed for transfor - mations to sustainability.20 NOTES 1 Mace and others 2014; Steffen and others 2015. 2 Reyers and others 2022. 3 Haider and others 2021. 4 Lyver and others 2017. 5 Thompson and others 2020. 6 Rocha, Peterson and Biggs 2015. 7 Lèbre and others 2020. 8 Díaz and others 2019; Lee 2020. 9 Maffi 2005, p. 602. 10 Keys and others 2019.11 Eriksen and others 2021; Hooli 2016. 12 Olsson and others 2017. 13 Lèbre and others 2020. 14 UNDP 2020b, p 5. 15 Moore and others 2014. 16 Njwambe, Cocks and Vetter 2019. 17 Olsson and others 2017 18 Haider and others 2021. 19 Lade and others 2017. 20 Moore and others 2018, p. 38. CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 61 Economic security is a cornerstone of wellbeing. Eco - nomic stability and some degree of predictability en - able people to plan and invest in their future and that  of their children. They encourage innovation, rein - force social connections and build trust in others and  in institutions.1 Worry and anxiety about the future  have negative health outcomes, ranging from mental  health problems to heart disease and increased risk  of obesity, including among children.2 Pervasive eco - nomic insecurity generates popular discontent and  imperils political stability. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, many peo - ple found themselves and their families on shaky  economic ground. Growing employment instability  and work that is increasingly precarious and poorly  paid, together with persistent joblessness, are root  causes of rising economic insecurity in high-income  countries. In low- and middle-income countries high  informal employment continues to affect income  stability. People can no longer rely on stable, decent  work to provide economic stability throughout their  lives  — a trend compounded by the Covid-19 pandem - ic and an emerging climate crisis. Increased awareness of climate change and its  many implications has injected growing uncertainty  about the future and raised people’s concerns about  their wellbeing in the long run. Even though the ef - fects are shaping anxieties worldwide, the impacts  will be uneven. People in the poorest countries, par - ticularly children and young people, stand to lose the  most. Indeed, people in poverty are more exposed to ad - verse events, from ill health to the growing impacts  of systemic shocks such as climate change and pan - demics, and have fewer resources to cope with and  recover from their consequences. However, many  people who are not poor by national or international  standards are or feel economically insecure as well.  In fact, while economic security and confidence in  the future have traditionally been defining features of the middle class, this group is feeling increasing - ly insecure.3 Workers in the informal economy and  the growing number of people under nonstandard  contractual arrangements are highly insecure, as are  people with lower education levels, women, younger  adults, members of racial and ethnic minorities and  heads of single-parent households.4 Despite its significance, growing economic in - security has stayed under the policy radar in many  countries. Experts find fault in the fact that it is not  adequately reflected in standard national statistics.5  Indeed, many measurement issues related to inse - curity are still unresolved, and empirical research on  developing countries is scarce. Whatever the method used to assess economic  risks, the implications of these risks depend crucial - ly on the buffers available. Catastrophic expenses  and large debts drive falls into poverty when social  protection systems do not help guard against risks or  cover their effects. Even in developed countries with  comprehensive social protection systems, compara - tive cross-country data suggest that public transfers  protect only about 40 percent of adults against large  drops in disposable income (drops of 25 percent of  disposable income or above).6 Not only are risks growing, but policies are also  not keeping up with current trends. Public institu - tions, policies and governance systems are struggling  to adapt to rapidly changing needs across  countries.  Social protection coverage is often contingent on a  traditional formal employer–employee relationship,  and many schemes are not portable across jobs. La - bour market institutions and regulations are also  challenged by the growing diversification of working  arrangements. There are, however, policy innovations in both de - veloped and developing countries that demonstrate  the capacity of social protection systems, labour  market institutions and public services to adapt to  changing circumstances. These include new forms SPOTLIGHT 1.5 On economic insecurity Jonathan Perry, Marta Roig and Maren Jiménez,  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs 62 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 of social protection that adequately cover informal  workers, migrant workers or those with nonstandard  contracts.7 There are also agile programmes that au - tomatically scale up in response to systemic shocks,  such as pandemics or climate-related emergencies.  Some groups of informal workers have pursued  new models of collective representation to protect  their interests, namely through cooperatives, self- help groups and associations. Some of these new  organizations have helped workers connect and un - dertake collective action, but many lack the legal  capacity to negotiate working conditions. A key  challenge for these organizations is that many in - formal workers are not considered workers under  the law and therefore do not have bargaining rights.  In some countries  — Canada, Germany and Swe - den, for instance  — collective bargaining rights have  been extended to some categories of self-employed  workers.8 Providing economic security remains a key role  of the state and its institutions and is a foundation  of the social contract between government and citi - zens. Many governments spend a substantial share  of GDP to safeguard against hardship-causing loss - es, through social protection systems, healthcare and  other public services. This is a crucial moment to re - flect on how to adapt past policies and institutions to  a new socioeconomic reality. Large-scale crises heighten risk and insecurity and  have, at times, opened a path to renew the social con - tract. The unprecedented income support and health  measures put in place by many governments as a re - sponse to the Covid-19 pandemic attest to the prima - ry role that the state continues to play in confronting  economic risk and insecurity. Policy responses to  the crisis have ranged from direct payroll support  to employers to covering income losses in informal employment to rent payments and eviction moratori - ums, not to mention expanding healthcare coverage  in traditionally underserved areas.9 However, many of these measures are temporary.  Most of them leave beneficiaries just as vulnerable  to future shocks once they are removed. Compre - hensive, universal social protection systems, when  in place, play a much more durable role in protecting  workers and in reducing the prevalence of poverty  than short-term, ad hoc measures, since they act as  automatic stabilizers. They provide basic income se - curity at all times and therefore enhance people’s ca - pacity to manage and overcome shocks. Countries with social protection systems already  in place were able to scale them up quickly during  the Covid-19 pandemic. Investments in building and  expanding social protection systems in some Latin  American countries over the past decades have cush - ioned the fallout from the crisis, at least in the short  term.10 Many other low- and middle-income coun - tries entered the crisis on weak financial footing,  however. Their ability to expand social protection  has been constrained by lack of fiscal space as well as  by a lack of existing mechanisms on which to build.  Overall, the financial support to individuals and fam - ilies has varied dramatically across countries, as has  access to vaccines and thus the speed of econom - ic recovery. Without urgent corrective action from  the international community, the current crisis is  likely to widen disparities both within and between  countries.11 Focusing on the challenges people face today  —  from increasingly precarious employment to inad - equate healthcare and difficulty accessing social  protection, housing and other public services  — can  narrow social, economic and political divides and  guard against the next global crisis.

CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 63 Humanity has entered a new era of risk created by  the confluence of twin crises  — one rooted in the  darkening global security horizon, the other stem - ming from ongoing environmental destruction. The  risks are complex and often unpredictable. While  failing to address either crisis adequately, govern - ments are not paying enough attention to the cross - over points where the most dangerous situations are  emerging. There are more hungry and displaced people than  a decade ago,1 twice as many state-based conflicts  and twice as many deaths in those conflicts.2 Govern - ments are spending more on their military forces.3  Even before the war in Ukraine, nuclear states were  increasing the number of warheads being held in  readiness for use.4 Meanwhile, the impacts of climate  change are worsening,5 plastic pollution and resource  depletion continue almost unabated and the health of  ecosystems declines. Half a century ago, at the United Nations Con - ference on the Human Environment in Stockholm,  governments formally recognized that ecological  integrity is essential to human development.6 Now,  the consequences of declining ecological integrity  are clear. The countries facing the greatest ecologi - cal threat are statistically likely to be among the least  peaceful. They also tend to be marked by fragility and  low capacity for resilience.7 Half of ongoing UN peace  operations are in the countries with the highest expo - sure to climate change impacts.8 A climate change impact or the disappearance of  an important food resource does not axiomatical - ly cause insecurity and conflict, but it does increase  the risk.9 The risk will be heightened if the society in  question is already tense, fragile or insecure and will  be lower if it is well-governed and well-resourced  (box S1.6.1). Additionally, insecurity can lead to peo - ple taking decisions that damage environmental  integrity.To succeed, transitions must be just and peaceful Turning back the tide of environmental decline is  necessary in order to reduce the risks and secure an  environment of peace. It will entail major transitions  in such sectors as energy, industry and land use.10  Transitions need to occur quickly and successfully.  However, interventions aiming to tackle an environ - mental problem can exacerbate insecurity or cause a  different form of environmental damage. In the 2000s the rush to biofuels led to landgrabs  in the Global South as producers looked to meet de - mand stimulated by policy choices in the Global  North. This contributed to soaring food prices and  resultant unrest in countries such as Burkina Faso,  Egypt and Haiti.11 Building hydropower dams has altogether dis - placed an estimated 80 million people on every in - habited continent.12 In Myanmar dam building has  forced displaced people into areas populated by other  ethnic groups, leading to clashes.13 Once in place,  dams restrict water availability for downstream use,  disrupt biodiversity and fish stocks important for  food, flood farmland and divide communities. Meeting the Paris Agreement 1.5°C target could  entail a 10-fold expansion of hydropower in Afri - ca.14 Governments and companies such as airlines  propose increased biofuel production.15 Unless a dif - ferent approach is taken, conflict and displacement  could result again. With the sixth mass extinction of species in Earth’s  history possibly under way, attempts to protect na - ture and biodiversity are at a crunch point. More than  90 governments now support the goal of protecting  30 percent of the Earth’s surface through conserva - tion by 2030, the so-called 30×30 initiative,16 which is  up for negotiation at the 2022 UN Convention on Bi - ological Diversity summit.17 However, with 300 mil- lion people living in key biodiversity areas, 30×30 has SPOTLIGHT 1.6 Building an environment of peace in a new era of risk Environment of Peace Initiative,  Stockholm International Peace Research Institute 64 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 provoked concern over land rights, indigenous peo - ples’ rights and food security.18 Two UN Special Rap - porteurs have warned of “fortress conservation.”19 Wind and solar power, set to become the main en - ergy sources in a rapidly decarbonizing world, have  historically generated very little conflict. However,  there are potential issues at both ends of the product  lifecycle, as there are with batteries for energy stor - age and electric vehicles. At the source end, concerns  focus on the human rights abuses connected with  some mining operations for minerals such as lithium,  cobalt and rare earth elements.20 At the disposal end,  wind turbines, solar panels and batteries need to be  made fully recyclable, to avoid the creation of poten - tially huge waste streams.21 The urgency of the crisis in nature and climate  change is so acute that rapid and profound transitions  are needed to halt and reverse it. Failure to do so will  inevitably lead to further security risks associated  with continuously rising impacts. However, failure to enact transitions in a fair and peaceful manner will be  a sure-fire recipe for both creating further insecurity  and conflict risks and compromising the prospects of  success. Beginnings of a new security Despite the gravity of the global situation, there are  hopeful signs from community projects up to the su - pranational institution level. Recognition within the United Nations of the rela - tionship between environmental degradation and se - curity dates back to at least January 1992, when the  Security Council declared that “non-military sources  of instability in the economic, social, humanitarian  and ecological fields have become threats to peace  and security.”22 The link has since been acknowl - edged in many other declarations and initiatives, in - cluding the Sustainable Development Goals and the Box S1.6.1 Haiti’s systemic shock Environment of Peace Initiative,  Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Haiti, the lowest income country in the Americas, has been beset by decades of political instability, natural hazards (in - cluding a massive earthquake in the Southern Peninsula of the country in 2010) and removal of tree cover, in turn leav - ing communities exposed to storms and landslides.1 In January 2020 the Haitian Parliament dissolved after elections  were postponed, with President Jovenel Moïse attempting to rule by decree against a backdrop of continuing public  unrest.2 Two months later Haiti reported its first cases of Covid-19. The government declared a health emergency, with  a familiar mix of school and business closures, limitations on transport and gatherings, and a night-time curfew.3 With three-fifths of the population already below the poverty line and antigovernment sentiment running high,4  people refused to abide by the regulations, boosting the infection rate.5 Agricultural production fell, and food prices  rose by more than 25 percent.6 In August tropical storm Laura came to Haiti, ruining 50–80 percent of certain crops  in the southeast.7 Unusually dry months followed, depressing harvests by up to 80 percent. Entering 2021, food prices  were running 40 percent above normal.8 In May 2021, with Covid-19 cases soaring, the government redeclared a state of emergency.9 In July tropical storm  Elsa hit the same southeast regions devastated by Laura the previous year.10 Four days later, for reasons that remain  unclear, gunmen assassinated President Moïse, unleashing a further period of political turmoil.11 Soon afterward, the  United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization declared that nearly half the Haitian population was in acute food  insecurity.12 Perhaps a country with stable politics could have coped with the two storms in quick succession. Perhaps without  the restrictions around Covid-19, political order could have been restored. But the combination of the previous de - cades of environmental destruction and political turmoil, unrest in the streets, Covid-19 and two major storms dealt  Haiti a systemic blow. Millions have been left without sufficient food or prospects, the only certainty being that more  insecurity lies ahead.

CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 65 Sustaining Peace initiative.23 Nevertheless, security  and environmental agendas have largely progressed  along separate tracks. The creation of the Climate Se - curity Mechanism in 2018 has built a bridge, but the  serial vetoing of resolutions on climate change and  security within the Security Council is one bar to full - er coordination. Several regional blocs also acknowledge the links  between environmental degradation and security, in - cluding the African Union, the European Union, the  Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Eu - rope and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.  The African Union recognizes that addressing human  impacts on the planet, such as climate change, will re - duce the risk of conflict and commits to tackling them  as a route to securing development.24 At the operational level, the UN Assistance Mission  in Somalia represents an important step forward. It is  the first mission to include a dedicated environmen - tal and climate security adviser.25 The United Nations  is deploying similar advisers elsewhere. Civil society organizations and international agen - cies have launched many initiatives that build peace  and address environmental degradation simultane - ously in historically conflict-prone areas. In the Sahel,  where climate change impacts and overuse of water  have exacerbated tension between pastoralists and  farmers, multiple projects are improving resource  management and animal health, facilitating access  to markets, helping pastoralists diversify sources of  income and managing conflict.26 Across the borders  of Israel, Jordan and the State of Palestine, the non - governmental organization EcoPeace builds mutual  understanding among communities whose security  is impacted by shortfalls in water and energy access  relating to environmental decline.27 In Uganda the  Strengthening Resilience and Inclusive Governance  project aims to defuse tensions between refugees and  host communities who would otherwise be compet - ing for the same charcoal resources and in the pro - cess would use it unsustainably.28 All these examples  can be learned from and scaled up. Towards an environment of peace There are, broadly, two areas in which governments  and other decisionmaking institutions need to take action to mitigate the growing threat to peace posed  by the twin crises. One is to link up responses to insecurity and envi - ronmental degradation, at every level from policy - making down to projects, so that manifestations of  the crises are tackled holistically. This cannot be only  about responses to emerging situations  — it must also  be anticipatory, involving horizon scanning, forecast - ing, knowledge sharing and resilience building. The second is to get on with solving the under - lying environmental threats. Security risks will keep  growing until society rebuilds the natural resource  base, restores biodiversity, aggressively limits pollu - tion and reduces greenhouse gas emissions to net-ze - ro. Moves to do this must be undertaken in a just and  peaceful way  — but they must be undertaken. The Stockholm International Peace Research In - stitute report Environment of Peace,29 launched in  May 2022, concludes with six recommendations for  action and five principles to guide them. The prin - ciples include approaching the crises cooperative - ly, because a nationalistic approach to threats faced  in common is clearly illogical and inefficient. Gov - ernments need to combine far-sighted vision and  strategy with urgent action and to adapt strategies  as they go along because the manifestations of the  twin crises will evolve. All the transitions needed  to halt and reverse environmental degradation, in - cluding climate change, must be enacted justly and  peacefully  — which also implies enacting them inclu - sively, ensuring that affected people are involved in  decisionmaking and share in the benefits. The recommendations themselves include some  that will build resilience. For example: • All governments should carry out a risk assess - ment on the security risks posed by environmental  decline. • All transboundary resources such as river basins  should be covered by resource-sharing agree - ments, and those agreements should be made fit  for purpose in an era of climate change. • Early warning systems for conflict should include  indicators of environmental change. Others address root causes. For example: • Governments should, as far and fast as possible,  stop funding conflict risk through building up  weaponry and subsidising fossil fuels and instead  fund environmental restoration and peace. 66 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 • The public and private sectors should proactively  identify and reduce conflict risks in the clean tech - nology supply chain. • Indigenous peoples and other marginalized groups  should routinely be involved in making decisions  that concern them. All the recommendations can be implemented  within the next few years. And all should be. Gov - ernments agreed, in approving the Working Group 2 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change in February 2022, that there is “a brief and  rapidly closing window to secure a liveable and sus - tainable future for all.”30 The context of its words was  climate change; but they are equally applicable across  the entire risk landscape of the twin security and en - vironmental crises. With the escalating risks having  been identified, it is clearly in every government’s  self-interest to act.

CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 67 New low-carbon technologies such as electric vehi - cles and renewable energy generation will require  much larger inputs of nonrenewable minerals than  are needed for high-carbon energy sources, such as  petroleum-powered cars.1 In many instances these  minerals are found in a very limited number of loca - tions, often low- and middle-income countries.2 Africa hosts some of the largest reserves of many  of the minerals used to produce low-carbon technol - ogies at scale.3 And by 2040 renewable energy is pro - jected to account for 75 percent of Africa’s new power  generation and 40 percent of its total power genera - tion.4 These two trends could boost economic growth  and improve living standards. But many resource-rich  countries have suffered from a “resource curse,” with  resource wealth fuelling violent conflict, heightened  poverty and social inequality.5 The shift to low-car - bon technologies and renewable energy raises con - cerns about potential “green resource curses.” There are multiple channels for low-carbon tran - sitions to lead to conflict and dispossession. A recent  mapping of renewable energy projects and conflict  sites across five African countries revealed a sub - stantial correlation. Proximity to a renewable energy  site was strongly associated with higher conflict risk  across green activities, ranging from establishing re - newable energy projects to green mineral mining to  producing renewable energy.6 Establishing and operating renewable energy pro - jects are frequently fraught with tension over land  acquisition, employment opportunities and benefit  sharing — often compounded by a lack of consultation  with existing landowners and users, especially where  customary land users may lack written documenta - tion of their claims. Grievances were compounded  by concerns about local employment opportunities  and the lack of a mechanism for reinvesting project  revenues in the local community.7 Moreover, many  residents in the communities closest to the project sites were not afforded access to the national electric  grid, despite ceding their historical lands for project  development. Tensions often persist after projects become op - erational. Key reasons include limited employment  opportunities and a perceived lack of benefit shar - ing among the communities most impacted by such  projects. When the benefits and value produced from  such projects are seen as benefitting far-away elites or  a rival status group, the potential for conflict is high.  This risk can be reduced by including local communi - ties and indigenous and marginalized groups in pro - ject planning. Green mineral mining is also a classic example of  a potential resource curse. From cobalt and coltan  in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to lithium  in Zambia and Zimbabwe to copper across much of  southern Africa, the region holds enough mineral  wealth to support the mass production of low-car - bon technologies.8 Yet, resource curse dynamics are  a threat where economic diversification is limited, in - stitutions are weak and potential for resource capture  is high. Even where conflict is less prevalent, many such  projects are plagued by unsafe conditions, environ - mental degradation and benefits that fail to accrue to  the local communities.9 Voluntary governance initia - tives, such as limiting the sale of conflict diamonds,  can help prevent green resource curse dynamics but  require coordination across the supply chain of min - eral producers, processers and consumers. The adverse impacts associated with renewable  energy production have yet to reach the conflicts  sparked by fossil fuel production. But given the pro - jected growth of renewable energy, active policy in - terventions will be needed to reduce conflict risks  associated with low-carbon transitions.10 Source: This spotlight builds on Aas Rustad and others (2022).SPOTLIGHT 1.7 Low-carbon transformations: A green resource curse? 68 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 NOTES 1 Leonard and others 2022; Aas Rustad and others 2022. 2 See, for example, IEA (2021b). 3 Aas Rustad and others 2022; IEA 2021b. 4 IEA 2014, 2019. 5 Aas Rustad and others 2022; Leonard and others 2022.6 Aas Rustad and others 2022. 7 Aas Rustad and others 2022; Schilling, Locham and Scheffran 2018. 8 Aas Rustad and others 2022; IEA 2021b; Leonard and others 2022. 9 Aas Rustad and others 2022; Frankel, Mucha and Sadof 2018; Ochab  2020. 10 Leonard and others 2022; Schilling, Locham and Scheffran 2018. CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 69 Pursuing socioenvironmental justice now and leaving  a thriving planet for the generations that follow require  both knowledge and imagination. Not only do we need  to know how to pursue and realize such things as social  justice and ecosystem health, but we also need to be  able to imagine relationships and responsibilities far  beyond our own temporally and spatially bound lives.  For instance, to “[meet] the needs of the present with - out compromising the ability of future generations  to meet their own needs,”1 we must both know what  meeting needs requires now and be able to imagine  what the lives of future generations might be like in a  range of different and distant futures. Philosophers have developed several theories of  intergenerational justice that animate the normative  underpinnings of our responsibilities to future gen - erations.2 Some theories take the view that justice  requires that we imagine ourselves choosing prin - ciples to govern intergenerational responsibilities.  To enforce fairness, the choice procedure removes  knowledge of exactly which generation we (the deci - sionmakers) will belong to.3 Other theories contend  that justice requires that we imagine having to justify  any courses of action we take now directly to our de - scendants who will inherit the consequences of those  actions.4 For other theories justice requires that we  imagine ourselves situated such that we must justify  our actions now directly to our ancestors given their  values, aspirations and expectations.5 Similarly, other  theories start out from the contention that justice re - quires we imagine ourselves as part of connected and  overlapping intergenerational communities extend - ing backwards and forwards in time.6 In line with this  view Indigenous philosophies situate each genera - tion as part of a “series of never-ending beginnings”7  — each born in the imaginations of generations past,  with the responsibility to set the course for the jour - neys that follow.8 Our cultural values, narratives and practices have a  vital role in protecting and enabling intergenerational links  — connecting past, present and future genera - tions.9 Polynesian ocean-voyaging narratives, for ex - ample, trace descent lines across the expanses of the  Pacific Ocean, the largest body of water on Earth,  in some cases all the way to the Southern Ocean and  Antarctica.10 Land-based narratives story ancestral  migrations that weave networks of communities into  the land and waterways  — embedding connections and  responsibilities through and across multiple genera - tions.11 Socioenvironmental practices enact values that  preserve relationships and knowledge transmission.12  Together, these theories, cultural values and practic - es provide critical conceptual and cognitive tools that  bridge distant people and places in ways that situate  the current generation as having responsibilities as  part of a far-reaching intergenerational community.13 Our theories, values and practices are grounded in  the aspiration to leave behind a thriving planet. This  aspiration is reflected in the way we live our individ - ual and collective lives hopeful that what we value,  create and pursue will endure. It is similarly reflected  in the way we make policies based in part on the leg - acies that those policies will chart and enable in the  long run. There tends to be, in other words, “a con - ceptual connection between valuing something and  wanting it to be sustained.”14 Indeed, what we leave  behind for future generations shapes not just how  meaningful their lives will be but how meaningful our  lives can be said to have been as well. The uncertainty complex outlined in this year’s Re - port, while reinforcing this aspiration, highlights a  more fundamental aspiration and challenge as well:  namely, that there will be a future of some sort at all.  While previous generations have largely been able to  take a stable planetary system for granted, our gen - eration faces the challenge of ensuring the planet’s  long-term survival. Such a predicament reinforces  the urgent need for pathways through which differ - ent ideas, fresh perspectives and appropriate socio - environmental practices can be enabled and enacted SPOTLIGHT 1.8 The new uncertainty complex and  intergenerational justice Krushil Watene (Ngāti Manu, Te Hikutu, Ngāti Whātua o Orākei, Tonga),  Massey University, New Zealand 70 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 now. More specifically, our collective challenge pro - vides an opportunity to adopt the kind of long-term  intergenerational thinking that grounds Indigenous  (and many other) philosophies  — which Tim Mulgan  refers to as “multigenerationalism.”15 According to  this view, the best way to find meaning in the world  today is to embark on projects spanning several gen - erations that come to fruition only long after the pres - ent generation is gone. To do multigenerationalism well, or even at all,  however, we must remember what we truly need to flourish,16 and we must be courageous enough to re - make our local and global systems in ways that will  truly enable and sustain that flourishing.17 What is  more, we have to find the courage to radically change  our values and narratives so that our descendants  might still be here to pursue planetary wellbeing and  justice long after we are gone.18 Perhaps most impor - tant, we must have “radical hope”19 — we must hope  for a world that we know may never materialize in the  future and yet still find the courage to hold the course  towards that future anyway.

CHAPTER 1 — A NEW UNCERTAINTY COMPLEX 71  PART I — UNCERTAIN TIMES, UNSETTLED LIVESCHAPTER 2 Unsettled minds in  uncertain times Mental distress —an obstacle to human development 74 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022Unsettled lives mean unsettled minds. What does that have to do with human development? This chapter makes the case that mental distress  weighs on human development in many ways,  ultimately limiting people’s freedom to live the lives  they have reason to value. The effects are especially  damaging to children and can perpetuate inequality  in intergenerational cycles of mental distress and  socioeconomic hardship. Breaking these cycles  requires action from people and policymakers on  three fronts: preventing distress, mitigating crises  and building psychological resilience.CHAPTER 2 Unsettled minds in uncertain times:   Mental distress —an obstacle to human development The preceding chapter documented the novel and  unprecedented uncertainties affecting people’s lives.  This chapter dives into how uncertainty can cause  mental distress,1 with implications for the way people  feel, think, act and interact with each other through - out their lives, restraining their freedom to achieve  and to live lives they have reason to value.2 It shows  how mental distress can constrain human develop - ment and reinforce and perpetuate inequalities. It  also emphasizes early childhood  — as crucial for de - veloping the brain and body but subject to the devas - tating consequences of toxic stress. Mental wellbeing shapes the way people think, act  and interact.3 Individual emotion,4 perception, cog - nition and motivation5 are set in a social context of  circumstances, relationships and culture.6 Emotions,  such as anger, can drive people to interpersonal vi - olence or to violent conflict, but they can also trig - ger actions against injustices (see chapter 3).7 And  emotions can help in dealing with an unpredictable  world (with some arguing that emotions reflect evo - lutionary adaptations).8 Healthy regulation of emo - tions and overall mental wellbeing are crucial for  peaceful and cohesive societies  — and thus for human  development. “ Healthy regulation of emotions and  overall mental wellbeing are crucial  for peaceful and cohesive societies  —  and thus for human development Mental distress can hinder people from devel - oping their full potential.9 For instance, even when  free high-quality education is universally available,  a student suffering from anxiety and insomnia has  the choice to go to school but may not be able to con - centrate because of mental distress and will thus not  be able to learn as easily as her peers. These individ - ual limitations in one aspect of human development  can be carried over to other dimensions and different  stages of the lifecycle, as when the same student later  seeks employment, and can even act intergeneration - ally through distress during pregnancy and beyond. A crucial task for people and policymakers is thus  to prevent and mitigate mental distress. Since not all  adversity can be prevented or mitigated, this chapter  and the policy options presented in chapter 6 empha - size the importance of psychological resilience that enables people to thrive despite adversity and that is  intrinsically linked to agency, a critical component of  human development (see chapter 3).10 How mental distress constrains  human development In the absence of psychological resilience, mental  distress can result in mental disorders. These are as - sociated with poor education achievements,11 low  productivity at work,12 poverty,13 premature and ex - cess mortality14 and poor overall health. Many people  suffer from mental health–related problems, com - monly measured by the number of diagnosed mental  disorders (spotlight 2.1). To understand the links among mental distress,  mental wellbeing and human development, the ca - pabilities approach  — focusing on the capabilities that  enable people to expand their freedoms to do and be  what they value and have reason to value  — can be  helpful. Capabilities are a combination of things a  person is able to do or be  — the various functionings  he or she can achieve.15 Each person has his or her  conversion function, with individual conversion fac - tors that determine the ability to turn resources into  capabilities (figure 2.1). While mental wellbeing can influence choices and  behaviour at multiple stages and can be a function - ing itself, mental distress shapes individual conver - sion factors, affecting each person’s ability to convert  goods and services into capabilities. The complete  set of achieved functionings also affects the amount  and intensity of mental distress a person is exposed  to. For example, a person with high income can afford  to live in a safe neighbourhood, but a person with low  income may not. So, the low-income person will be  exposed to more mental distress caused by neigh - bourhood insecurity, which in turn will affect her con - version factors. In childhood The impact of mental distress on conversion factors,  and thus capability sets, shapes not only children’s  individual lives but also human development pros - pects in adult life, with implications for society. Expo - sure to frequent or long-term toxic stress or adversity,  CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 75 combined with weak support systems, impairs the de - velopment of neural circuits responsible for emotion - al self-regulation, cognition and behaviour.16 In some  cases this creates long-term physical and mental  health problems, including damage to the developing  brain.17 A child’s developing brain sets the foundation  for future learning, behaviour and health.18 Damages  are difficult, though not impossible, to remedy later  in life. When stressors such as domestic violence, child  maltreatment or extreme poverty activate the stress  response system frequently or over an extended pe - riod, physiological responses that usually deal with  short-term stress remain activated or become per - manently calibrated to activate more easily and do  not turn off as readily as they should. They then can  overwhelm the biological system (called allostat - ic overload) and impair the development of neural  connections (figure 2.2).19 Abundant empirical ev - idence shows that this process, apart from causing (chronic) mental disorders, can increase the pos - sibility of obesity, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular  disease, substance abuse, autoimmune disease, im - paired cognition and interpersonal and self-directed  violence.20 And even without mental disorders, emo - tions and cognition can be impaired with a similar  effect on some parts of the body, since processes in  the brain are linked with those in the microbiome and  the gut.21 These interactions shape the possibilities for learn - ing, earning good income and leading a long and  healthy life. They can thus constrain the conversion  function and the ability to turn resources into ca - pabilities and may shape choices with potentially  long-lasting effects throughout the lifecycle. Basic  trust established during infancy22 and supportive re - lationships with caregivers and other adults in the  community can buffer some of these effects23 and  build resilience. Role models are especially im - portant, as is perceived self-efficacy  — both shape Figure 2.1 Mental distress constrains freedom to achieve, choices and achievements ResourcesIndividual conversion factorsCapability  setChoice   Social context and inﬂuence Functionings Mental distressAchievements Means to  achieveFreedom to  achieve Source: Human Development Report Office based on Lengfelder (2021) and Robeyns (2017). 76 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 children’s aspirations and beliefs in how much they  can achieve.24 But when caregivers and other adults  in the social network themselves face adversity or  permanent stressors, these support structures may  be weak or even counterproductive. Severe maternal  distress also seems to alter DNA.25 Mothers’ exposure  to adversity can increase defensive behaviour among  offspring, which might be biologically useful in ma - lign environments but can also lead to pathologies,  even among children raised in safe environments  after the adversity subsides.26 Such children are not necessarily doomed for life.  Multiple biological, psychological, social and ecolog - ical systems interact to build resilience, which helps  them absorb some distress throughout the lifecycle. The interplay of individual, social and community  factors can produce secure attachments, cognitive  reappraisals, family cohesion, social structures and  support networks.27 Exposure to nature can also make  a difference. People, particularly children,28 who are  frequently exposed to nature or spend much time  outdoors tend to be more resilient to adversity and  mental distress than those who do not.29 In adulthood For adults severe mental distress can impair capa - bilities in a similar way  — but at a time when the de - velopment of the brain and other organs is already  Figure 2.2 Connecting mental and physical health Brain and autonomic nervous system Manage and respond Neuroendocrine system Maintain hormonal balance Immune system Defend against infection and  health injuryHeart and cardiovascular system Pump blood, distribute oxygen and glucose Gut and metabolic system Turn food into energyStress response Fight or ﬂightStressors Stressors Source: National Scientific Council on the Developing Child 2020. CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 77 advanced or concluded. Still, adults who suffer from  mental distress over an extended period have im - paired conversion factors, resulting in constrained ca - pability sets (or freedoms to achieve). That includes  the ability to continue learning, to work and earn in - come, to lead a long and healthy life, to have attach - ments to things and people, to form perceptions of  good and bad, to plan one’s own life, to affiliate with  others, to care about other species and to enjoy rec - reational activities30 — even if external conditions are  favourable. Some external conditions, such as access  to information or health services, can also help build  psychological resilience among adults, which can ab - sorb some of the stress and provide room to deal with  future adversity.31 Mental health at older ages part - ly reflects individual adversities and resilience, but  some other mental disorders common among older  people have other causes.32 “ In uncertain times mental distress among  individuals can have costs for societies,  as it restrains people from reaching their  full potential throughout the lifecycle  In uncertain times mental distress among individ - uals can have costs for societies, as it restrains peo - ple from reaching their full potential throughout the  lifecycle  — thus constraining human development.  And since different people are exposed to different  levels of mental distress, it can increase inequalities  and even perpetuate them when distress is trans - ferred from caregivers to children. Unsettled minds amid  multidimensional uncertainties New and persistent drivers of insecurity unsettle peo - ple’s lives in the context of uncertainty (see chap - ter 1). They include multiple forms of violence, which  comprise violent conflict between groups and inter - personal violence, ranging from domestic to neigh - bourhood violence. Other stressors may not always  threaten physical wellbeing but can still cause serious  mental distress: discrimination, exclusion, econom - ic insecurity and uncertainties associated either with  the more frequent and extreme hazards of the An - thropocene or with transitions and rapid technologi - cal change, as with digitalization.The Anthropocene context is a driver of uncertain - ty without precedent in human history. It is manifest  not only in climate change but also in biodiversity  loss and the depletion and contamination of natural  resources.33 Efforts to ease planetary pressures are  also a source of uncertainty, driving real or perceived  threats associated with the transitions in economic  and social systems in a context of rapid digital trans - formation. Precarious jobs, digital inequality, cyber - attacks, data fraud and concentrated digital power  can all cause serious mental distress. This section  discusses evidence showing how these manifesta - tions of uncertainty affect mental wellbeing and can  also drive inequalities in human development. Minds pressured in the Anthropocene As discussed in chapter 1, dangerous planetary  change in the Anthropocene is reflected in climate  change, biodiversity loss and the more frequent  emergence or re-emergence of zoonotic diseases,  with Covid-19 likely the latest. The effects on mental  wellbeing run through several channels: • Traumatizing events. The increase in extreme  weather events often goes hand in hand with losses  or damages of housing or crops as well as injuries  and even deaths of loved ones. These experiences  can cause tremendous human suffering, often  leading to post-traumatic stress (spotlight 2.2),  anxiety, depression, distress, grief, survivor guilt,  substance abuse and even suicide.34 • Physical illness. Exposure to extreme heat can cause  heat exhaustion, leading to mental distress.35 And  sharp spikes in temperature cause irritability, more  aggressive thoughts and feelings, and even vio - lent behaviour.36 Following distress and grief that  Covid-19 has caused around the world (see below),  the constant possibility of another deadly variant  or a new zoonotic disease also pressures minds in  the Anthropocene. • General climate- or eco-anxiety and solastalgia.  Climate change can have two different effects on  people, depending partly on psychological resil - ience. It increases general anxiety and worries  about the future,37 which encourages some people  to become agents for climate action but may leave  others feeling anxious and incapable of changing  78 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 anything.38 Young people claim that governments  around the world have dismissed or neglected their  requests for urgent action.39 Indigenous peoples  from around the world, among the most affected  by climate change, have suffered mental distress  over seasonal changes and acute weather events.40 • Food insecurity. With increasing extreme weather  events disrupting food production and access,  food insecurity is on the rise again after decades  of decline.41 In addition to being a threat to phys - ical health, it is also a serious mental stressor.42 It  has been associated with psychological distress in  both low and high human development countries.43  In several African countries women and older  people are especially affected. The most effective  interventions target livelihoods as opposed to  income only.44 • Biodiversity loss. Biodiversity loss can drive mental  distress, especially among indigenous and mar - ginalized communities, leading to longer-term  adverse psychological and behavioural impacts,  such as increased family stress, amplification of  previous trauma, greater likelihood of substance  abuse and higher prevalence of suicide ideation.45  While causal mechanisms are yet to be fully under - stood, some reasons can include that biodiversity  loss causes disruptions to physical health through  altered food systems or leads to a different sense  of place that can undermine cultural practices  and knowledge systems. Moreover, it can impair  self-determination by reducing the sufficiency of  locally available resources, and it can result in a  loss of social capital as community members rely  increasingly on outside sources of aid and income  rather than on one another.46 The adverse consequences of climate change are  already affecting people who more directly depend  on agriculture and natural resources for their live - lihoods, including those in communities in rural,  coastal, mountainous or forest areas, many of them  indigenous.47 Since many of these people live in low- income countries and are already disadvantaged,  mental distress and its effects on the conversion fac - tors can further increase inequalities in freedoms to  achieve. The depletion of natural resources and land-use  changes through deforestation and for agricultur - al use are putting pressures on biodiversity and threatening the integrity of ecosystem functions, with  several unknown threats potentially to come, includ - ing more frequent zoonotic diseases.48 As discussed  in chapter 1, the Covid-19 pandemic may be the latest  but surely will not be the last, with implications that  include multiple lockdowns all over the world that  may cause mental distress in the future as they did  during Covid-19.49 “ Biodiversity loss can drive mental distress,  especially among indigenous and mar  ginalized  communities, leading to longer-term adverse  psychological and behavioural impacts During the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic,  the global prevalence of depression and anxiety in - creased by more than 25 percent.50 The increase  was greater among women than men, most likely  because women were more affected by the socio - economic consequences of lockdowns.51 In a global  survey 77  percent of respondents reported moderate  to severe stress and poor sleep, and 59 percent suf - fered from anxiety and 35 percent from depression  (only 18 percent had previously been diagnosed with  a mental disorder).52 Young people suffered  — most  likely because of missed opportunities during multi - ple lockdowns.53 People with low incomes, struggling  to afford basic needs such as rent and food, suffered  disproportionally in several countries.54 Women, who took on most of the additional do - mestic and care work that emerged during school  closures and lockdowns,55 faced more mental dis - tress than before the Covid-19 pandemic.56 A cross- country survey found that 27 percent of women  struggled with mental distress, compared with  10 percent of men. Women cited their escalating un - paid care burden as a critical stressor, alongside con - cerns about food, healthcare and livelihoods. Given  the links among employment, income, food security  and mental health, it is noteworthy that 55 percent of  women reported income loss as the top impact of the  pandemic (compared with 34 percent of men) and  that 41 percent of women (versus 30 percent of men)  reported not having enough food.57 Ethnic minorities  of both sexes were severely affected in the United  Kingdom, with the largest increase in mental distress  among men with a background from Bangladesh,  India or Pakistan (figure 2.3).58 CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 79 More than two years into the Covid-19 pandemic,  worries about the virus have somewhat dissipated in  parts of the world. But anxiety about new variants  —  and the possibility of mandatory quarantines, lock - downs and cancellations  — remains around the globe.  The abrupt halt and related uncertainty that the pan - demic inflicted on many people’s lives will likely lin - ger for some time. Economic insecurity drives mental distress Economic insecurity  — expressed in periods of low in - come, unemployment, poor working conditions, pov - erty, housing instability and financial shocks  — can  cause mental distress. Even the perception that such  outcomes could materialize may give people reason  to worry, particularly in contexts of economic precar - iousness or dislocations. And even when these dislo - cations are transitory or small relative to the scale of  an economy, they can loom as scary threats in par - ticular regions or sectors.59 The causal relation also works in reverse: people  with impaired mental (and physical) health have fewer employment opportunities and can face income pen - alties for their conditions.60 Especially in economic  contexts where brain-based skills such as emotional in - telligence, creativity, cognitive flexibility, self-control  or system thinking matter more than manual skills,61  mental wellbeing is increasingly important to thrive in  the professional world, while the lack of it can further  exacerbate disadvantages. In other contexts where  people work in agriculture, they are being increasingly  exposed to the stresses of extreme weather events that  jeopardize their source of income and food security  —  and with it both physical and mental wellbeing. The association of economic insecurity with men - tal distress starts very early in life, indeed in the  mother’s womb. Some foetuses are exposed to more  stress and worry related to poverty, malnutrition, vi - olence or environmental irritants associated with  poverty (such as pollution or extreme temperatures)  than others.62 The intergenerational effect contin - ues during childhood when parents’ mental distress  impairs children’s wellbeing, with effects into adult - hood.63 If the situation continues throughout child - hood, this can lead to long-term adaptive behaviour  and pathologies that are hard to break later in life.64  For instance, children who grow up with food insecu - rity often continue binge eating even after hardship is  overcome.65 These effects can be buffered by social  institutions or informal aid in the community, such as  cash transfers to mothers, which have been shown to  improve infant brain activity and subsequent cogni - tive skills and mental wellbeing.66 Even less severe conditions of low socioeconomic  status and related social structures can affect chil - dren’s brain and body development, cognitive func - tioning and mental and physical health. For example,  children in families who live in crowded, chaotic  or noisy conditions or unsafe neighbourhoods and  who lack organization and daily routines are usually  exposed to higher mental distress.67 And the belief  in how much one is capable of achieving — which is  usually lower in low socioeconomic status families   — can diminish children’s aspirations and achieve - ments.68 These factors can accumulate,69 which is in  line with models of cumulative advantage and dis - advantage that look at socioeconomic disparities in  general and health disparities in particular.70 The  2019 Human Development Report analysed in de - tail how this mechanism acts in intergenerational Figure 2.3 In the United Kingdom mental distress is most  prevalent among female minority groups, but mental  distress among male minority groups increased most  during the Covid-19 pandemic Mental distress BIP  menNon- BIP  menWhite British  men15 14 13 12 11 010 BIP  womenNon- BIP  womenWhite British  women95% conﬁdence  interval2017–2019 April 2020  BIP refers to people with a background from Bangladesh, India or Pakistan.

However,  even people with higher incomes can experience re - sentment and frustrations due to financial concerns,  especially when aspirations are very high and the so - cial environment is such that people perceive high in - equality compared with their peers.80 Status incongruence is an important concept here.  For example, having a high level of education in a  manual occupation or low-skilled nonmanual occupa - tion has been shown to cause emotional discomfort,  such as feelings of shame and anxiety,81 pessimistic  outlooks and overall poor mental wellbeing. With  rising education levels and labour markets that are  unable to absorb all qualified labour, cases of status  incongruence have increased and are expected to be - come even more prevalent.82 Positive expectations  and belief in the ability to achieve one’s goals can par - tially compensate for negative effects on mental well - being.83 Finally, at older ages a higher debt burden  Box 2.1 Multidimensional uncertainties may make some people subject to human trafficking — another source of  severe mental distress Multidimensional uncertainties make some people want to look for a better future elsewhere. But bureaucratic ob - stacles often stand in the way of free migration, so that some people fall victim to human trafficking. Networks  of organized crime consisting of traffickers typically make false promises of education or job opportunities using  fraudulent employment agencies to trick victims before applying violence and coercion.1 The experience of being  trafficked is often traumatic, with restriction of movement and violence, and fear of being discovered, detained and  deported.2 An Ethiopia-based study found that among human trafficked returnees the prevalence of depression was  about 58 percent, that of anxiety 52 percent and that of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 35 percent. Restricted  movement was associated with anxiety, depression and PTSD, whereas experiencing violence during trafficking was  linked to anxiety and PTSD. Detention contributed to all three disorders.3 A study of trafficked women and girls from Monterrey and Reynosa (Mexico) found that all of the study’s participants  were experiencing feelings of tension, stress, anxiety, worry and anger and that most of them were crying more than  usual (86 percent), lacking appetite (86 percent) and having suicidal thoughts (80 percent).4 Among human trafficking  survivors in the Greater Mekong subregion, men, women and children who had experienced violence during traffick - ing faced a higher prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD than those who did not.5 In addition to experiencing  mental distress, many victims of human trafficking do not find what they had expected at their destination but face  new challenges, such as adaptation to a new environment and sometimes even dependence and human rights  violations from their traffickers. From a human development perspective human trafficking takes away people’s agency and freedoms as well as  the possibility for them to make their own choices and determine their futures. Managing safe migration is crucial to  tackling human trafficking and should be taken up through cooperation and partnership among countries.

CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 81 can cause social and emotional loneliness, independ - ent of social participation, social network size, and  previous states of anxiety or depression.84 Moreover,  there is a growing understanding of the long-term  impacts of income downturns.85 When an econom - ic downturn coincides with a health shock, as with  Covid-19, the implications can be magnified and per - petuated across generations.86 The channel for much  of the lasting scarring to take hold relates primarily  to behavioural and psychological impacts that have  implications throughout life, even after the economy  bounces back.87 Causality also runs the other way. Mental distress  lowers people’s ability to work productively and dis - torts the way people think, with consequences for the  way they search for work, interact with people and  carry out their work.88 Alleviating financial worries  improves workers’ productivity, making them more  attentive, faster and less prone to mistakes,89 as pov - erty appears to burden cognitive capacity (but see the  discussion in chapter 3 suggesting that the burden  may be contingent on social context).90 It can also  modify the content of cognition, adding a monetary  perspective to many dimensions of life, which is diffi - cult to suppress and may shape decisionmaking and social relationships.91 Conversely, poverty alleviation  can improve socialization and other noncognitive  skills, such as agreeableness and conscientiousness,  while diminishing hostility and aggression.92 Severe mental distress can undermine physical  health, which can lead to an inability to carry out cer - tain work  — and increase health spending where there  are gaps in health insurance or public provision of  health services.93 Furthermore, mental distress can  result in job loss or income decline, not least because  it affects preferences, beliefs, cognitive functioning  and ultimately economic decisionmaking.94 People  with depression earn about 34 percent less than the  average person, people with bipolar disorder about  38 percent less and people with schizophrenia about  74 percent less. People with these conditions also  face a much higher risk of no income and disability.95  And the lack of income can cause even more men - tal distress. The circular relation has been found to  nearly double the negative impact of financial shocks,  explaining low financial resilience in a long-term  mental distress–  poverty trap.96 The circular and intergenerational relation between  economic insecurity and mental distress can perpetu - ate economic inequality across generations (figure 2.4).

They can even accelerate the achievement of the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).97 A recent  study covering more than 200 countries found that  mobile phone access was associated with higher gen - der equality through multiple channels (lower mater - nal mortality, better information about sexual and  reproductive health services, higher empowerment  to make independent decisions, with larger gains  among the least developed countries and among the  most disadvantaged groups).98 In this sense digitali - zation can contribute to empowerment, essential for  mental wellbeing. But the benefits of these new technologies also  come with challenges. Digitalization poses sever - al social and economic threats, including, but not  limited to, lower labour demand for some tasks,99  digital inequality and exclusion,100 cybercrime and  the related theft of financial resources and personal  information,101 transfer of decisionmaking powers  to machines, digital power concentration,102 digital  addictions103 and violence,104 and reduced personal  life security.105 One of the most serious challenges  of digitalization is digital inequality.106 Poor peo - ple and those with existing mental disorders have  a higher probability of being digitally excluded,  which potentially increases inequalities in other  areas.107 Some of these challenges can cause mental dis - tress, despite the fact that some of the benefits of  digital technologies foster mental wellbeing (figure  2.5). For instance, cyberharassment and cyberstalk - ing have been associated with anxiety, panic attacks,  suicidal ideation108 and depression.109 Mobile devices,  social networks and cloud computing services can be  used to stalk people and conduct surveillance.110 Dig - ital platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twit - ter can be used in a similar way as well as for social  comparison, negative interactions, cyberbullying,  and sharing violent content and violent or discrim - inative language.111 This has been associated with  mental distress and suicidal behaviour, with the  highest prevalence among girls.112 Older people may  feel excluded from socialization when the younger generation spends time on social media or with other  technologies. Digital exclusion can be found among healthcare  services. While digital healthcare services can pro - vide substantial benefits for people with fast internet  connections and digital skills  — and thus have poten - tial to widen access to health services among some  remote populations (box 2.2) — people without these  advantages are less likely to benefit from services.113 While access to information can be empowering,  abundant and sometimes false information (which is  easy to distribute through social media) can also be  a source of anxiety. Not only can people feel anxious  because of too much and sometimes contradictory  information, but they may also stress about infor - mation that is not even true. During the early stag - es of the Covid-19 pandemic, and often continuing  beyond, false information about the virus, its cures  and vaccines went viral on communication platforms  such as Facebook and Twitter, causing anxiety in  many people.114 The abundance of information seems  to constitute a stressor (information overload), mak - ing it more likely that people share false information.115 Another way digitalization can cause men - tal distress is obsessive use of digital technol - ogies, digital platforms and digital devices.116  Obsessive smartphone use can result in chronic sleep Figure 2.5 Digitalization is a double-edged sword for  mental wellbeing Empowerment  through access to  information Easier access to  mental health services More opportunities  for (virtual)  social engagementBeneﬁts for mental wellbeing Information overload  and false information Digital addictions Cybercrime Cyberharassment,  cyberstalking,  cyberbullying and  social isolation Burden for mental wellbeing Source: Human Development Report Office. CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 83 deprivation and undermines cognitive control and  socioemotional functioning.117 Digital technology  can also promote gambling — an activity associated  with mental disorders.118 Young people in particular  appear to engage in digital gambling on social plat - forms, smartphones and specialized websites.119 The  World Health Organization has recognized gaming  disorder as a mental health issue, given its adverse  health impacts and increasing prevalence.120 Cybercrime, such as fraud, theft, scams and other  forms of online financial exploitation, can cause ex - cessive worrying and anxiety and has been linked to  depression among older adults.121 Moreover, inter - net use reduces offline interaction, political partici - pation and civic cultural engagement,122 increasing  the likelihood of social isolation.123 By contrast, dig - ital technology can also create social engagement  opportunities that help eliminate loneliness and so - cial isolation124 and improve wellbeing125 — for exam - ple, by connecting to people with similar interests or  problems over long distances (self-help forums). By  doing so, digital technology can also alleviate mental  distress.126Violence scares, unsettles and scars lives Given the direct threat to physical integrity, most  forms of violence cause mental distress, often lead - ing to mental disorders such as post-traumatic stress  disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression, and each  form of violence comes with additional challenges  depending on context and setting. Interpersonal vi - olence includes domestic and community violence,  such as intimate partner violence, child or elder abuse  and assaults by strangers. Collective violence occurs  between larger groups, such as organized crime and  armed conflicts.127 Interpersonal violence can increase  inequalities in opportunity Psychologically, domestic violence is extremely toxic,  as the home is a place that should provide protection  and safety, constituting a location to rest and relax  away from other environmental stressors. When sev - eral forms of domestic violence happen simultane - ously, they can create a vicious cycle of dependence Box 2.2 Potential of telehealth for increasing access to mental healthcare Digitalization can improve health systems and the provision of healthcare services1 if digital technologies are readily  available to the whole population. Mobile and electronic interventions allow easy access to mental health services  and information on prevention, counselling and treatment.2 Telehealth, which involves telephone or video via various  web-based applications,3 has gained global prominence over the years. By 2016 more than 50 percent of countries  that responded to a World Health Organization survey reported having a national telehealth policy, about 70 percent  claimed to have a teleradiology programme and approximately 25 percent said they had conducted a telehealth  programme evaluation.4 In many parts of Africa, particularly in rural areas populated mostly by young people, there  is great potential for expanding telehealth services.5 The Covid-19 pandemic massively increased telehealth pro - grammes and platforms. In the United Kingdom the proportion of doctor’s appointments over the phone or by video  call increased from 13 percent in 2019 to 48 percent by mid-2020.6 In some East Asia and Pacific countries7 and in the  United States,8 the number of telehealth users more than doubled in the first month of the pandemic. Since most mental health services do not require physical examinations, digital services are especially promising,  allowing people from remote areas to get help online without traveling long distances. Such services can be more  time and cost efficient, providing support while people wait for face-to-face interventions.9 Undermining these benefits are poor network infrastructure, inadequate funding to support telehealth programmes,  competing health system priorities, internet access inequalities and a lack of digital skills among all or parts of the  population.10 So for digital mental health interventions to improve health outcomes without increasing inequality,  countries need to increase telehealth budgets, expand internet access in deprived communities and empower people  from these communities through education and training on how to use digital devices and platforms.

For instance, the perpetrator controls the  household’s financial resources, making the victim  financially dependent,128 while invoking fear and un - dermining self-worth and self-esteem through verbal  abuse, constant criticism and social isolation, which  can lead to a withdrawal from the labour force, hous - ing stress and ultimately a loss of self-identity.129 The  key here is dominance over the partner through emo - tional, economic or psychological abuse,130 which  then substantially limits the possibilities to escape  physical violence as well. This mechanism is reflected  in data showing that in countries with lower female  labour force participation, more women experience  intimate partner violence (figure 2.6). While men can  certainly also be affected, the majority of intimate  partner violence survivors are women.131 Bisexual and gay men report worse psychologi - cal consequences following intimate partner vio - lence than straight men.132 This is possibly due to the combined burden of mental stressors, including  discrimination, and social pressures of internalized  masculinity norms suggesting that men should be  more resistant to oppression and violence.133 Due to  gender stereotypes in some criminal justice systems,  there also appears to be hesitance to report assaults  out of fear of being misjudged as the perpetrator. In  various country contexts men who had filed police  reports recounted that authorities had responded to  their plea for help with suspicion, ridicule or even  arrest.134 When older people live in a household with fami - ly members, which is common in some cultural con - texts, domestic violence can also be directed towards  them, affecting their physical and mental health.135  This happens more frequently among older people  with physical disabilities (49 percent) and with psy - chological disabilities (7 percent). Many, but not all,  affected older people are female (63 percent).136 Figure 2.6 Intimate partner violence increases with economic dependence Reported intimate partner violence within the past 12 months (%)Female labour force participation (%)  0102030405060708090 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Note: Reported intimate partner violence within the past 12 months includes women and girls over age 15 who have experienced physical and/or sex - ual partner violence.

CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 85 The consequences of domestic violence for mental  wellbeing range from milder symptoms such as ele - vated psychological stress to full-fledged clinical pres - entations of mental disorders such as PTSD, phobias,  substance abuse, depression and anxiety.137 Survivors  of physical domestic violence are also prone to trau - matic brain injury, with devastating consequences for  their ability to function in society, including to work  and socialize.138 All of this can eventually result in a  loss of agency, when individuals no longer feel able to  shape and change their circumstances, lose hope al - together and become vulnerable to revictimization.139 “ More than half the world’s children ages 2–17— around a billion—have experienced emotional,  physical or sexual violence, with devastating  consequences for their mental wellbeing Even when physical attacks are not targeted to - wards them, children are affected through three  channels: • Witnessing attacks on one of their caregivers. • PTSD symptoms of caregivers that undermine  quality of care. • Traumatizing parenting styles or emotional un - availability that emerge as a result of caregivers’  mental distress.140 When children themselves fall victim to psycho - logical, sexual or physical abuse, mental distress is  most severe. More than half the world’s children ages  2–17 —  around a billion  — have experienced emotional,  physical or sexual violence.141 When stressors come  from outside the home, stable relationships with car - egivers typically function as buffers for children’s  mental wellbeing. But when caregivers become ag - gressors, one of the most important instincts  — trust  in caregivers  — becomes damaged, equalling betray - al by the people the child depends on.142 It impairs  basic trust in life and can have severe long-term, and  sometimes irreversible, consequences for children’s  psychological and physical health as well as for their  overall functioning, causing what is called complex  childhood or developmental trauma.143 The conver - sion function of these children thus differs from those  of children who grew up in a nonviolent household,  unless a very favourable combination of resilient  building factors comes together and absorbs part of  the toxic stress the child has suffered.144 Culturally aligned interventions are crucial here, as discussions  of domestic violence are still taboo in many societies,  hindering social workers from intervening and mak - ing mental health treatments available for children. Community violence ranges from isolated acts of  assault by strangers or acquaintances, such as bully - ing, armed robbery and sexual abuse, to workplace  and institutional violence.145 Neighbourhoods are not  simply the physical locations in which we reside; they  are also places with intricate socioeconomic–spa - tial connections (box 2.3).146 While neighbourhood  characteristics  — including education and healthcare  facilities, transport connectivity and crime levels as  well as perceived safety and social cohesion  — may  affect outcomes such as health, education and in - come,147 these same outcomes in turn determine  which neighbourhoods are accessible to people.148  This effect constitutes an obstacle to intra- and inter - generational mobility, as it can trap people in cycles  of low income, poor health and education, and sur - roundings prone to amplifying these disadvantages.149  Mental distress is an additional risk factor in this trap,  given its consequences for cognition, productivity  and overall functioning.150 For children, who typically  depend on their parents’ housing decisions, the effect  is equally strong, if not more severe, since they are  much more vulnerable to mental distress than adults  (see the first section of this chapter).151 Taken to - gether, these factors can perpetuate inequalities, not  only between neighbourhoods but also between cit - ies, countries and regions, as levels of violence vary  across different areas. Collective violence can increase  inequalities between groups of people In some areas of the world, the root cause of neigh - bourhood violence is organized crime. People who  reside in neighbourhoods where drug cartels or other  criminal groups operate experience more mental  distress, not least because of the perceived threat of  violence. Evidence from Mexico shows that informa - tion about brutal acts, such as executions, and about  violent confrontations between the local police and  criminal groups has caused substantial mental dis - tress for community members. On some occasions  this information may be diffused purposely to in - stil fear in the community.152 Mental distress caused  86 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 by organized crime is not limited to victims and the  community. Members of criminal groups also suffer  from mental distress because of chronic exposure to  violence, potentially increasing cycles of violence, as  some types of mental distress can result in aggressive  behaviour.153 Violence during protests, riots and clashes with the  police can cause emotional imbalances, fears, wor - ries and even psychological trauma. Over the past  decade protests, sometimes accompanied by related  political violence, increased substantially, until the Covid-19 pandemic hit (figure 2.7).154 When political  climates change and authorities do not fully respect  the right to freedom of expression, people may sense  repression and start feeling impotent or powerless. Sometimes, frustration throughout the population  can also turn into clashes between protesters and  police, causing mental distress. A protester from  India claims, “[I] freeze up, feel[ing] numb and  uncertain anytime [I] see a policeman, or some - one wielding a lathi, or when streetlights go off.  … I see people break down in gatherings… friends Box 2.3 Neighbourhood violence is bad, but uncertainty around it can make it even worse Direct exposure to violence and the possibility of  experiencing violence as a resident of a neighbour - hood that is perceived as unsafe are significant risk  factors for mental distress. Across Buenos Aires,  Lima, Medellín, Mexico City and São Paulo expo - sure to interpersonal violence — for example, being  beaten up, witnessing death or someone getting in - jured, being mugged or threatened with a weapon,  and sexual violence — and the experience of living  in neighbourhoods with a higher prevalence of  violent crime (after individual violence exposure is  accounted for) are associated with higher odds of  anxiety and mood disorders.1 In Baltimore, Maryland, survey respondents liv - ing in violent crime hotspots report higher rates of  depression (61  percent higher) and post-traumatic  stress disorder (85  percent higher) than residents  in coldspots.2 Depression can be caused by indirect  exposure or other factors related to living in violent  neighbourhoods. In some cases the perceived level  of violence in the neighbourhood and the uncer - tainty around being exposed to it can be at least as  troubling. Adolescents in California who perceive their  neighbourhood as unsafe are twice as likely to ex - perience serious mental distress as their peers who  perceive their neighbourhood as safe. They are also  more likely to suffer from distress than adolescents  who live in neighbourhoods that are considered violent based on objective measures (box figure 1).3 Mental distress can also be exacerbated by an interplay of other factors. Several of these factors in a population- based survey of adults living in a group of favelas  (slums) in Rio de Janeiro — specifically being younger, female or  unemployed; having a lower income; and having experienced and fearing neighbourhood violence — were separately  and significantly associated with poorer mental health outcomes. These factors, together with past experiences of  violence and the fear of violence, were also significantly associated with higher levels of mental distress.4 Notes 1. Benjet and others 2019.  2. Weisburd and others 2018.  3. Goldman-Mellor and others 2016.  4. Cruz and others 2021.Box figure 1 Perceived risk can induce more stress than  actual risk Share of adolescents in California with  serious psychological distress (%) 3.8 9.8 4.1 6.8 Safe Unsafe Nonviolent Violent Perceived  neighborhood safetyObjectively measured  neighborhood violence02468101214161820 Note:  Whiskers indicate the 95 percent confidence interval.

CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 87 getting full-blown panic attacks.”155 The effect can  be as severe as the ones caused by armed conflict,  in which WHO estimates the PTSD rate to be a little  over 21 percent.156 A study from Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region, China, found a combined  prevalence of depression and PTSD of 21.8 percent  among the adult population during the 2019–2020  social unrest. There was also a strong association  between heavy politics-related social media use and  mental distress, attributable to emotion contagion.157  Following violence in Syrian Arab Republic, civilians  expressed panic attacks, especially towards the pos - sibility of “disappearing” while being transferred in  detainment.158 The Syrian conflict also shows how  collective violence, such as riots, battles or violence  against civilians can escalate into armed conflicts  and civil wars.159 When that happens, severe and long-lasting men - tal distress can be the consequence for large parts  of the population, given the nature of traumatic  experiences related to war settings. From the early  2000s until the outbreak of the war in Ukraine,  there have been few interstate conflicts, but the  past decade has witnessed a surge in battle-related deaths due to civil conflicts, some subject to foreign  state interventions.160 In postwar settings about one  in five people suffer from mental health conditions.161  PTSD is very common among war survivors, affect - ing about 354 million adult war survivors,162 not  least because of the direct threat to experiencing vi - olence and the constant possibility of loss or injury  of loved ones.163 Grief and sadness have been relat - ed to addictive behaviour, particularly to increased  substance abuse.164 This may put an additional bur - den on public health systems, considering the long- term consequences of substance abuse for mental  and physical health. Globally comparative data on the prevalence of  PTSD remains a challenge, but more specific exam - ples from war torn countries can provide deeper in - sights into the number of affected people and into  the mechanisms and causalities behind them. Due  to recurrent wars and armed conflicts in Iraq, for ex - ample, the prevalence of PTSD among young people  ages 17–19 is 25 percent,165 and more than two-thirds  of adult men suffer from anxiety and emotional in - stability.166 In Nigeria the Boko Haram insurgency  has contributed to major mental distress, including Figure 2.7 Increases in political violence have meant more uncertainty for many people Number of events 150,000 100,000 50,000 0Protests Riots Battles Violence  against civilians 2020 2010 2015 Note: Protest  is defined as a public demonstration in which the participants do not engage in violence, though violence may be used against them.  Battle  is defined as a violent interaction between two politically organized armed groups at a particular time and location. Battles can occur between  armed and organized state, nonstate and external groups and in any combination therein. Riot is defined as a violent event where demonstrators or  mobs engage in disruptive acts, including but not limited to rock throwing, property destruction and the like. Violence against civilians  is defined as  violent events where an organized armed group deliberately inflicts violence upon unarmed noncombatants. The perpetrators of such acts include  state forces and their affiliates, rebels, militias, and external or other forces (ACLED 2019).

There are other, cul - turally aligned explanations for what people feel and  go through, and following those, people may seek al - ternative approaches to integrative health and men - tal wellbeing.171 About 450  million children  — or one in six  —  currently live in conflict zones, with devastating  consequences for their mental health,172 including  PTSD.173 The PTSD prevalence rate was 44 percent  among child survivors of the Rwandan genocide and  87 percent among children exposed to the bomb - ings in Gaza.174 In Nigeria Boko Haram has recruited  young children to join its militia, causing severe men - tal distress associated with warfare.175 Some of these  effects can be long-lasting if not adequately treated:  children who survived the Viet Nam war show in - creased symptoms of depression in adulthood.176 Apart from the threat to physical integrity, armed  conflicts can expose people to displacement, de - stroy critical infrastructure, disrupt supply chains,  hinder investment and thus undermine economic  growth and development, possibly resulting in mas - sive unemployment — all adding to mental distress of  large parts of the population.177 When armed conflict  forces people to leave their homes, this complicates  the overall situation even further. As of mid-2022 at  least 100 million people are estimated to have been  forcibly displaced from their homes worldwide due  to conflict, with major displacements in Afghanistan,  Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of the Congo,  Ethiopia, Myanmar, Nigeria and Ukraine.178 The war in Ukraine has caused a major increase in  displaced people, with more than 7  million internal - ly displaced persons and more than 5.6 million refu - gees.179 Children, who account for about half of the  displaced, become exposed to all sorts of mental dis - tress.180 Globally, there are now nearly 37 million dis - placed children  — the highest number ever recorded.181  When displaced, people may lose their material pos - sessions, community affiliations and social support networks. And if they flee to another country, possi - bly even their civic duties, access to social services,  professions, occupational identity and much else  — all  risk factors for mental distress that affect people’s ca - pabilities sets.182 In such an environment where peo - ple suffer from impaired health, limited education  opportunities and unemployment, mental distress is  more likely to set in but less likely to be treated be - cause resources are desperately needed on all ends.  Indeed, countries experiencing conflict present the  widest gap between people who need mental health - care services and people who have access to them.183  Community-level approaches are promising for facil - itating access to mental healthcare services in these  settings (box 2.4). “ Some groups of people have been excluded,  disrespected and discriminated against for  centuries, with devastating effects on their mental  wellbeing and human development at large Because some groups of people are affected more  by violence than others, and thus suffer more from  mental distress than others, the alteration of their  conversion factors limits their freedom to achieve  and thus increases inequality of opportunity across  neighbourhoods, districts and even countries, de - pending on the level of violence people are experi - encing (and on access to mental healthcare services  and other resources that can mitigate distress). More - over, the exposure to violence can itself create vicious  cycles of even more violence if left unattended. Discrimination unsettles minds by  attacking human dignity Some groups of people  — including women; certain  ethnic groups; people of colour; people who identify  as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, inter - sex or other sexual minority (LGBTQI+); and people  with disabilities  — have been excluded, disrespected  and discriminated against for centuries, with devas - tating effects on their mental wellbeing and human  development at large. At the institutional level dis - criminatory norms and laws of some countries still  bias the criminal justice system and block access to  high-quality education and health services, economic  CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 89 opportunities and wealth accumulation, attacking  human dignity and increasing inequalities.184 Since many measures of development capture out - comes at the aggregate level, horizontal inequalities  often remain unrevealed, resulting in policies that fail  to address structural discrimination. But people also  suffer from discrimination in their daily lives, when at - tacked or excluded by peers, colleagues or neighbours  or on the streets. Both types of discrimination can  cause mental distress and interact with inequalities, mutually reinforcing each other and creating inter - generational cycles of inequality and discrimination. Structural discrimination reinforces inequalities Structural discrimination and racism have been  found to increase overall health disparities through  several channels,185 including mental distress, envi - ronmental adversities and unequal healthcare.186 Dis - crimination can be seen as a latent form of violence, Box 2.4 Tackling mental distress at the community level The rationale behind community-based mental health services is that they tend to have greater acceptability among  the population — and better accessibility and affordability than most other healthcare options. They typically enable  family involvement, are less prone to stigma and discrimination, promote mental health awareness and have en - hanced clinical effectiveness given the involvement of trusted local providers.1 One example is the Mental Health  Innovation Network’s Basic Needs Mental Health and Development Model, which has reached more than 650,000  people and their family members in different low- and middle-income countries. It has increased access to treatment  among service users by 84 percent, and users have reported a 75 percent reduction in symptoms — all while costing  only $9.67 a month per person.2 In some countries, including Rwanda, South Sudan and Mexico, tackling mental  distress at the community level has become an important part of the public health strategy. Rwanda The 1994 genocide in Rwanda has had numerous long-lasting adverse effects on mental health among citizens,  including high rates of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).3 Like other countries, Rwanda has made  efforts to address the population’s mental distress. In seeking to ensure the availability of mental health services  at the community level by 2024,4 the government has used several strategies, such as establishing mental health  facilities in all community units and health centres, enhancing the quality of mental healthcare by constructing a Na - tional Mental Health Care Center, and improving reporting and surveillance systems to manage and conduct patient  follow-ups.5 Over time the government has decentralized mental healthcare and maintained at least one psychologist  and psychiatric nurse per hospital.6 Such interventions help the people who suffer from mental disorders to heal, to  establish strong social networks at the community level and to become emotionally more resilient.7 South Sudan South Sudan’s people also struggle with mental distress, such as depression, anxiety and PTSD caused by conflict,  violence, economic hardship and poor access to healthcare, among others.8 To help people suffering from mental  distress, including those who have experienced armed conflict and violence, the International Committee of the  Red Cross’s mental health teams provide counselling services in South Sudanese health facilities such as primary  healthcare centres, physical rehabilitation centres and surgical wards.9 This approach is similar to the Rwandan one in  that it tries to leverage local public health infrastructure and trusted networks to spread access to mental healthcare. Mexico Mexico’s mental health policy involves increasing public mental health awareness, community care and outpatient  services as well as keeping the need for hospitalization to a minimum, among others.10 Specifically, to address mental  disorders, Mexico uses the community mental healthcare model, which involves developing outpatient clinics, reha - bilitation centres and sheltered homes,11 to ensure access to mental health services even in remote areas.12 Notes 1. Kohrt and others 2018.  2. MHIN 2022.  3. Rwanda Ministry of Health 2018.  4. Rwanda Ministry of Heatlh 2018.  5. Rwanda Ministry of Health  2018.  6. Smith and others 2017.  7. Hynie and others 2015.  8. ICRC 2020.  9. ICRC 2020.  10. Block and others 2020.  11. Alvarado and others  2012.  12. Block and others 2020. 90 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 constituting a psychological stressor that has been  empirically related to depression; anxiety; delinquent  behaviour; alcohol, tobacco and drug use as coping  mechanisms; metabolic disease; cardiovascular dis - ease; low birth weight; and prematurity.187 Structur - al or systemic discrimination can sometimes turn  into actual violence, going hand in hand with human  rights violations. The most extreme case is genocide,  but other forms of human rights violations and dis - respect of human dignity have left entire minority  groups, such as the Rohingya or Yazidi populations,  with serious mental health problems as well.188 Ex- clusion and discrimination can impair certain groups’  mental wellbeing, as with migrants who struggle in  adapting to the host country, specifically with cultur - al congruity, identity and even bereavement.189 Cul - turally aligned healing approaches are especially  important here, because different people believe in  different things, which may alter the effectiveness of  some mental health interventions. In the case of racism, the effect on mental well - being can be intergenerational: vicarious racism   — that is racism experienced by parents and then  transmitted to children  — can affect children’s men - tal, physical and socioemotional health (some exam - ples include increased body mass index, depression,  anxiety, substance use, delays in cognitive develop - ment and increased healthcare use for sick visits).190  This effect runs mainly through children’s increased  threat perception, harsher parenting practices, more  complicated parent–child relationships and racial  socialization  — that is the information children re - ceive about race and racism.191 Younger children are  at higher risk of developing long-term defensive pat - terns when indirectly exposed to racism (see above  about the effects of threat on long-term behaviour - al consequences). Children who are affected by dis - crimination and have insufficient psychological  resilience or resources to build it may become even  more disadvantaged with respect to their peers. Interpersonal discrimination harms societies Structural discrimination involving institutions, rules,  and norms is not the only attack on people’s digni - ty. Discrimination and exclusion among peers, col - leagues or neighbours or on the streets may also leave  psychological scars that last a lifetime if untreated. Apart from race and ethnicity people are sometimes  discriminated against due to their sexual orienta - tion or gender identity. In some countries  LGBTQI+  people have 4.5 percent stronger symptoms of de - pression and a 40 percent higher social interaction  anxiety rate than their non-LGBTQI+ counterparts.192  When minority statuses overlap  — for example, when  an LGBTQI+ person identifies as ethnic minority  —  the effects of discrimination may multiply, making  the person more vulnerable than individuals with a  single minority status.193 LGBTQI+ young people ap - pear to be especially vulnerable to discrimination  —  important, given their delicate stage of development  and identity formation. Some national surveys on this  minority group have found that: • More than 75 percent of LGBTQI+ young people  report having experienced discrimination based on  their sexual orientation or gender identity. • More than half of transgender and nonbinary  young people have seriously considered suicide  within the past year, 71 percent experienced symp - toms of anxiety disorder and roughly 62 percent  have had major depressive disorder.194 • Almost all survey participants (95 percent) report  difficulty sleeping at night, and 70 percent had felt  worthless or hopeless during the past week. • Only 26 percent of participants feel safe at school.195 The two major mental disorders are also more  common among LGBTQI+ young people, though  there is no significant variance between different eth - nic identities (figure 2.8).196 “ Mental distress caused by exclusion,  disrespect and discrimination is one more  factor that can increase multidimensional  inequalities within societies Mental distress caused by exclusion, disrespect  and discrimination is one more factor that can in - crease multidimensional inequalities within socie - ties. Where discrimination does not directly increase  health disparities, the mechanism runs through men - tal distress, which ultimately impairs physical health,  hindering people from developing their full potential  and living lives they have reason to value. These dis - advantaged people then have different conversion  factors from their peers  — and thus different capabili - ty sets (freedom to achieve) — which further increases  CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 91 multidimensional inequalities. In some cases this will  further exacerbate discrimination, exclusion and dis - respect because victims are often blamed for their dis - advantaged condition in meritocratic societies.197 It  is up to us to stand up against discrimination, protect  each other mutually in socially cohesive societies and  exercise agency when it comes to resilience building. Human development in uncertain times This chapter shows how mental stressors do not act in  a vacuum; they are interconnected and may reinforce  each other,198 particularly in the context of uncertain - ty described in chapter 1. At the same time multiple  systemic factors can help build resilience,199 as ex - plored in part II of the Report. Different sources of  toxic stress affect not only people’s mental wellbeing  but also their physical health, especially at an early  stage of the lifecycle, given that body and brain are  still developing. Child, youth and even foetal devel - opment are functions of socioeconomic, political and social structures, among many others, all of which  determine the level of adversities and distress people  are exposed to. So, individual conversion factors  —  meaning each individual’s ability to convert resourc - es into capabilities (freedom to achieve) and later into  functionings (achievements) — will vary between peo - ple and throughout the lifecycle. The intergeneration - al effect of this mechanism is remarkable due to the  strong impact of toxic stress and adversities during  pregnancy and early childhood. Mental distress can  also affect the capability set of adults, as several ex - amples throughout the chapter show. In both cases the  expansion of capabilities will be hindered, restraining  people’s choices to live lives they have reason to value.  Mental distress can thus shape individuals’ levels of  human development as well as the aggregate level of  human development of countries and regions, with  consequences for inequality within and between  countries and regions (figure 2.9). This chapter shows the implications of uncertain  times  — from economic insecurity to anthropogenic Figure 2.8 High levels of mental distress among young people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual,  transgender, queer, intersex or other sexual minority (LGBTQI+) 65% 60% 65% 65% 70% 64% 76% 71% 72% 60% 75% 68%LGBTQI+ youth who experience symptoms of: Generalized anxiety disorder Major depressive disorder By gender identity Cisgender Transgender or nonbinary By age65% 77% 70% 73% 67% 40%69%53% 13–17 18–24By race/ethnicity Asian or Paciﬁc Islander Black Latinx Native or indigenous White More than one race or ethnicity Source: The Trevor Project 2021. 92 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 pressures, digitalization, violence, discrimination  and exclusion  — for mental distress and how mental  distress can in turn constrain human development for  some people in some places, potentially increasing inequalities.

CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 93 Measuring mental wellbeing is challenging because  the concept is much wider than the mere absence  of mental disorders.1 Not all people who suffer from  mental distress develop mental disorders, and many  people do not seek professional help due to stigma or  a lack of access to mental health services (including  for lack of insurance coverage). They may thus not  identify their condition as a mental disorder.2 Hence,  numbers that count these disorders are underesti - mated. Moreover, mental wellbeing is neither binary  nor constant throughout the lifecycle. It is a complex  continuum that can comprise all sorts of stages, from  ideal wellbeing to severe emotional pain, disorienta - tion and suffering.3 Not enough is done to enhance mental wellbeing  and provide help for people who go through phases of mental distress. On average, countries spend less  than 2 percent of their healthcare budget on mental  health.4 Due to a lack of resources, inaccurate as - sessments and shortage of trained medical staff and  healthcare providers, only about 10 percent of people  worldwide who need mental health interventions re - ceive them.5 Even with partial and incomplete information on  the extent of mental disorders, the evidence shows  that they place a massive burden on every aspect  of human livelihoods  — on relationships, educa - tion, work and community participation.6 Before  the Covid-19 pandemic one person in eight world - wide, or 970 million people, suffered from a men - tal health disorder, more women than men.7 And  more than 700,000 people die by suicide each year, SPOTLIGHT 2.1 Measuring mental wellbeing — an ongoing effort Figure S2.1.1 Global prevalence of selected mental disorders, 2019 050100150200250300 Anxiety disordersDepressive disordersIdiopathic developmental intellectual disabilityAttention- deﬁcit/ hyperactivity disorderConduct disorderBipolar disorderMillions of people Men Women Note: Anxiety disorders incorporate disability caused by experiences of intense fear and distress in combination with other physiological symptoms.  Depressive disorders include disability from major depressive disorder and dysthymia; major depressive disorder involves the experience of de - pressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure almost all day, every day, for two weeks, and dysthymia symptoms are less severe but chronic. Idiopathic  developmental intellectual disability captures the health loss resulting from intellectual disability that arises from any unknown source. Attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder is an externalizing disorder, incorporating disability from persistent inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity. Conduct  disorder occurs in those under age 18 and incorporates disability from antisocial behaviour that violates basic rights of others or major age-appro - priate societal norms. Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder incorporating disability from manic, hypomanic or major depressive episodes (IHME 2021).

But  for every death by suicide there are at least 20 more  attempts, an expression of severe human suffering.8  Although more men than women die by suicide, more  women attempt suicide.9 Mental health problems are also the single lead - ing cause of disability worldwide.10 Children, ado - lescents and older people are most affected. WHO  estimates that, globally, approximately 20 percent  of children and adolescents11 and about 15 percent  of people age 60 and older suffer from mental dis - orders.12 The most common mental disorders are  anxiety (affecting 300 million people worldwide) and depression (affecting 280 million people; figure  S2.1.1).13 Most of these people live with their condi - tion without ever receiving treatment.14 Much more  work is needed to statistically embrace the concept of  mental wellbeing, develop adequate measurements  for it and offer universal services to enhance it. The cause of diagnosed mental disorders varies  with context and evolves over time, interacting with  several factors, from genes to the environment. Only  about 26 percent of the variation in anxiety15 and  37 percent of the variation in depression is due to var - iation in genes (heritability).16 For other mental dis - orders the proportion can be higher.17 This chapter  focuses on the effects of distress on mental wellbeing  for which nonheritable factors are most relevant. NOTES 1 While the literature still lacks of a clear definition of mental wellbeing, the  World Health Organization (WHO) defines mental health as “a state of  well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can  cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully,  and is able to make a contribution to her or his community” (WHO 2022b). 2 WHO 2022c. 3 UNICEF 2021c; WHO 2022c. 4 WHO 2022c. 5 PAHO 2019; WHO 2021c. 6 WHO 2021e, 2022b. 7 WHO 2022c.8 WHO 2021d, 2021f. 9 WHO 2022c. 10 PAHO 2019. 11 WHO 2021f. 12 WHO 2017. 13 IHME 2021. 14 WHO 2022c. 15 Purves and others 2020. 16 Lee and others 2013. 17 Lee and others 2013. 95 CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES SPOTLIGHT 2.2 Post-traumatic stress disorder — not just from combat Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become  known mostly as a psychological condition common  among war veterans who have returned from combat  and been severely traumatized by their experiences  on the battlefield. Less known is that PTSD is com - mon among the general population, caused by child  abuse, domestic violence, life-threatening accidents,  political violence, human rights violations and disas - ters associated with natural hazards. Trauma is “a direct personal experience of an event  that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other threat to one’s physical integrity; or  witnessing an event that involves death, injury, or a  threat to the physical integrity of another person; or  learning about unexpected or violent death, serious  harm, or threat of death or injury experienced by a  family member or other close associate.”1 A wide range of symptoms can develop (table  S2.2.1). As every human being and each traumatic  event differs, strength, duration and types of symp - toms vary among survivors. Initially, traumatic ex - periences trigger the “fight or flight” response in  Table S2.2.1 Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder among adults and children Symptoms among adults Symptoms among children  →Avoidance of thoughts, feelings or conversations  associated with the event as well as of people, places  or activities that may trigger recollections of the event  →Trauma-related thoughts or feelings (such as fear,  horror, anger, guilt or shame)  →Intrusion: Recurrent, involuntary and intrusive  recollections  →Dissociative reactions  →Inability to remember an important aspect of the event  (not due to head injury, alcohol or drugs) — usually  caused by dissociative amnesia  →Persistent and exaggerated negative beliefs  →Persistent inability to experience positive emotions  →Diminished interest or participation in activities  →All summarized as depression  →Persistent, distorted cognitions about the cause or  consequences of the event and possible blame on self  or others  →Feelings of detachment or estrangement from others  →Irritable or aggressive behaviour and angry outbursts  →Reckless or self-destructive behaviour  →Hypervigilance  →Exaggerated startle response  →Concentration problems  →Sleep disturbance (traumatic nightmares) →Affect dysregulation  →Aggression against self and others  →Unmodulated aggression and impulse control  →Dissociative symptoms (numbing, splitting, fragmentation)  →Depression  →Separation anxiety disorder  →Oppositional defiant disorder  →Phobic disorders  →Disturbed attachment patterns  →Rapid behavioural regressions and shifts in emotional states  →Loss of autonomous strivings  →Failure to achieve developmental competencies  →Altered schemas of the world  →Anticipatory behaviour and traumatic expectations  →Chronic feelings of ineffectiveness  →Impaired memory  →Diminished concentration  →Visceral dysregulation and muscular contraction  →Anxiety  →Somatization (for example, gastrointestinal distress, migraines, chronic  back conditions)  →Attentional and dissociative problems  →Difficulty negotiating relationships with caregivers, peers and,  subsequently, intimate partners  →Chronic inflammation  →Type 2 diabetes  →Obesity  →Especially with sexual assault: • Substance abuse • Borderline and antisocial personality • Eating, dissociative, affective, somatoform, cardiovascular,  metabolic, immunological and sexual disorders • The loss of bodily regulation in the areas of sleep, food and self-care • The apparent lack of awareness of danger and resulting self- endangering behaviours • Self-hatred and self-blame Source: Lengfelder (2021) based on American Psychiatric Association (2013), Center on the Developing Child (2013), Danese and Lewis (2017),  Danese and others (2014), Hackett and Steptoe (2017), Heller and LaPierre (2012) and Van der Kolk and others (2005). 96 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 the body. When this biological response is not pro - cessed, as through rapid eye movement sleep or  therapy, it remains activated in later life, when it  is no longer necessary or useful. Trauma survivors  then remain hypervigilant, with startling responses  long after the traumatic event.2 They may also de - velop depression  — persistent and exaggerated nega - tive beliefs about themselves, others and the world,  combined with an inability to experience positive  feelings and a loss of interest in activities important  before the trauma. Depressed individuals may feel  detached or estranged from others with an increas - ing feeling of isolation, exacerbating the negative  worldview.3 Some individuals tend to avoid thoughts or emo - tions related to the traumatic event, whereas others  experience especially strong emotions or thoughts re - lated to the trauma. The disproportional significance  of the trauma can impede focus on other aspects of  life. Some thoughts can be intrusive, leading to in - voluntary recollections of memory that had been lost  due to fragmentation or (partial) amnesia.4 Other  consequences may include concentration problems, sleep disturbances,5 or aggressive, reckless or self-de - structive behaviour.6 Early childhood trauma is a special case in which  the impact on daily life goes beyond the symptoms of  regular PTSD.7 Even after children are removed from  the traumatizing setting, problems with self-regula - tion, emotional adaptability, relating to others and  self-understanding may continue throughout life.8  And post-traumatic stress in early childhood is asso - ciated with obesity, chronic inflammation and type  2 diabetes.9 Chronic dissociation and partial amne - sia are two common symptoms of early childhood  trauma that can affect brain functioning and devel - opment with long-lasting consequences.10 Chronic  dissociation detaches real-life situations from emo - tions, suppressing natural responses (such as crying  when something sad happens), which are important  for mental wellbeing. Difficulty with recalling mem - ories from one’s childhood may lead to distorted  identity formation when it is unclear what happened  where, when or why during certain stages of one’s  life, and it may cause self-doubt when feeling unable  to rely on one’s own mind and memory.

CHAPTER 2 — UNSETTLED MINDS IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 97  Harnessing human  development  to navigate  uncertain times PART I — UNCERTAIN TIMES, UNSETTLED LIVESCHAPTER 3 100 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022There is promise and peril in uncertainty. Tipping the  scales towards promise is up to us. But how do we do this? This chapter doubles down on human development  writ large. Wellbeing achievements matter, but more  is needed to expand people’s agency and freedoms  to help us navigate and flourish in uncertain times. This chapter also argues for widening the vista on  human behaviour, going beyond models of rational  self-interest to include emotions, cognitive biases  and the critical roles of culture.CHAPTER 3 Harnessing human development  to navigate uncertain times Enhancing human development in  uncertain times: The end, but also  the means, to navigate uncertainty Being sensitive to what is happening in the world today  implies taking notice of a novel uncertainty complex  that is unsettling people’s lives, as chapters 1 and 2 doc - umented. But uncertainty, engendering the possibility  of change, can also mobilize action and be a source of  hope. It is not that more unpredictability is better  — but  that the glaring, and often increasing, injustices pre - vailing today call for change. So does the imperative to  ease planetary pressures. They both call for transfor - mation, as does the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable De - velopment, subtitled “Transforming Our World.” Transformation is an opportunity to shape a world  that is more just for people living today and in the  future  — by addressing behavioural inadequacies and  institutional and policy gaps.1 So how are the defi - ciencies to be addressed?2 Behavioural change and  institutional and policy reform are mutually interde - pendent: institutional choices and their effectiveness  in shaping better outcomes are contingent on behav - iours and on varying social, economic, political and  cultural circumstances.3 The interaction of behav - iours and institutions is shaped by public reasoning  and procedures of social choice (figure 3.1).4 Given  that outcomes are contingent on behaviour and cir - cumstances, how can social choice be shaped so that  it advances a transformation to a more just world  while easing planetary pressures? This is where doubling down on human develop - ment comes in. Advancing human development, the aspiration behind every Human Development Re - port, is not only the end but also the means for peo - ple to strive for change that leads to better outcomes  by harnessing diverse and plural views in productive  ways. Human development is about expanding capa - bilities, so equitably expanding capabilities is central  in assessing development progress and evaluating  policies.5 Capabilities are not exhausted with wellbeing  achievements. One key distinction relates to the dif - ference between advancing a person’s wellbeing and  promoting a person’s agency (spotlight 3.1; see also  spotlight 3.2). Doubling down on human development (wellbeing  and agency) opens the space to explore options to  shape our future. Many institutions are designed and  policies implemented based on specific behavioural  assumptions (that people are rational only if they pur - sue the maximization of their individual wellbeing  while assuming that everyone else is doing the same).  But it is possible to draw on a richer understanding  of human behaviour and motivation.6 Central to the  human development approach is the emphasis on  people’s ability to participate individually and collec - tively in public reasoning — subjecting prevalent be - liefs and purported reasons to critical examination  and retaining those to be sustained after doing so. The pursuit of human development recognizes  that people have plural identities and affiliations and  value a plurality of dimensions, often simultaneously.  Broadening the vista of how people behave, briefly re - viewed below, suggests how an approach centred on  the pursuit of human development may be the means  to navigate uncertainty. Human development lever - ages a richer understanding of how people behave as  well as the potential for social choice, through indi - vidual and public scrutiny of beliefs and reasons, to  marshal institutions and public policies that advance  justice while easing planetary pressures. How to do so  in practice is the subject of part II of the Report. Widening the vista of human behaviour Many institutional designs and policy recommen - dations assume that people behave as “rational”7  agents (see spotlight 3.3). Much can be accomplished  by using this assumption to descriptively under - stand many social and economic processes and to Figure 3.1 Behavioural change and institutional reform are  mutually dependent Interactions are mutually  dependent and based  on public reasoning  and procedures of  social choiceBehavioural changeInstitutional policy change Source: Human Development Report Office. CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 101 normatively clarify the implications of different so - cial choices (column 1 in table 3.1). But descriptively,  this assumption corresponds to a very limited way of  representing how people make choices. For instance,  it poses very high demands on people’s cognitive  processing power, which has long motivated alter - native framings of bounded rationality.8 It also corre - sponds to a very narrow understanding of the role of  the social context,9 which has motivated arguments  specifying how social embeddedness matters.10 The  explosion of behavioural economics and behaviour - al science has documented many deviations in ac - tual human behaviour from what this assumption  would predict.11 The role of emotions, and how peo - ple come to reach and stick to beliefs, has also been  increasingly explored. This has provided a broader  framework for understanding human behaviour and  why it sometimes seems hard for people to act indi - vidually and collectively in the face of uncertainty.  This broader understanding widens the set of justi - fications and inspiration for policies and institutions  (column 2 in table 3.1). The human development approach’s considera - tion of agency alongside wellbeing highlights the  relevance of expanding beyond the assumption that  choices are driven exclusively by the pursuit of the  welfare of individuals, interest groups or countries  —  recognizing that this pursuit does matter and often  dominates.12 But it need not be the exclusive driv - er of choice. Amartya Sen described people who are  assumed to always exclusively pursue egoistically individual payoffs while assuming that everyone else  is doing the same as “rational fools,”13 because mu - tual choices based on this assumption often lead to  suboptimal outcomes for all involved.14 He argued  further that elements such as the choice process (in - cluding the menu of available options to choose from)  and the fact that choices may have to be made even if  a judgment has not been fully completed also point to  a richer set of determinants of choice than maximiz - ing individual material interests. That opens space  for “the sociological exploration of the complex val - ues that influence people’s conduct.”15 Recent evidence from cognitive neuroscience nu - ances the commonly held view that what people  value is simply what gives them happiness, rewards  or pleasantness. People can value something because  of the goals they are pursuing, and these goals (and  therefore, what they value) can change with circum - stances (for example, a compass is more important  than a diamond for someone lost in the desert). This  goal-  dependent usefulness is critical in guiding be - haviour and constructing value  — and is particularly  important when circumstances change.16 But what  people value is not only associated with need; it can  also be the result of notions of responsibility.17 The  notion of responsibility could be influenced by so - cial norms of conduct or individual ethical reflection  but takes us to the realm of agency. In particular, Sen  argued that responsibility could be crucial in what  he called the “operation of ‘environmental values,’  which is one of the reasons why the market analogy  Table 3.1 Behavioural assumptions: Determinants and scope of interventions to shape choices “Rational” agent Behavioural agent Encultured agent Individual  determinants of  choicePreferences (stable, autonomous);  beliefs (isolated from preferences,  based on collecting and processing  information)Preferences (can be fickle),  beliefs (can be motivated),  plus emotions (can change  preferences and beliefs)Preferences, beliefs, emotions  shaped by social constructs  (cultural mental models) Cognition Maximizes utility and assumes  everyone else is doing the sameCognitive limitations and biases  (endowment effect) universal  and hardwired, social context  (norms, social preferences)Culture shapes psychological  traits; culture contingent on  context and evolving over time Social determinants of  choicePrices, rules of the game (emerge  from a unique equilibrium)Prices, rules of the game, plus  social context (norms, framing  of choices)Experience and exposure to  culture, which creates mental  models (categories) Scope of actions to  shape choicesIncentives to correct market failures  (externalities), governance (improve  the rules of the game)Incentives, governance, plus  choice architecture (nudge,  prime), social normsIncentives, governance, social  context, plus social identities,  worldviews, narratives (which  prime certain behaviours) Source: Human Development Report Office based on Hoff and Stiglitz (2016). 102 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 is often quite deceptive in assessing ‘existence values’  of what people try actively to preserve in nature.”18 “  People tend to make choices under what is  called narrow framing. That is, they do not  evaluate all possible outcomes and weigh them  against one another but focus on one or a few  that are more salient for different reasons The insights briefly reviewed here are not new, but  today’s uncertain times make them more relevant  —  and may, in fact, call for completely new analytical  tools (spotlight 3.4; see also spotlight 3.5). Going be - yond the “rational” agent and the behavioural agent  and recognizing the role of the broader social con - text in shaping people’s choices gets us to the encul - tured agent (column 3 in table 3.1).19 This provides an  even wider scope of interventions, one that includes  a more prominent account of the role of the social  context and the potential of widening ways of inter - vening to confront today’s uncertain times. In build - ing this argument, the chapter explains the relevance  of the human development approach to seize that  potential. A psychologically richer description  of behaviour under uncertainty One example where the deviations of the rational  choice model matters for the analysis in this Report  relates to how people make choices under uncertain - ty. In many cases choices appear to be based on the  evaluation of changes in wellbeing from a certain ref - erence point,20 as opposed to being based on the eval - uation of levels of wellbeing.21 There might be a deep  biological and cognitive foundation for this,22 given  that human perceptual systems are broadly adaptive:  what we find cold or hot or bright or dark is driven in  part by a contrast with a frame of reference, typically  our recent experience with temperature or light.23 People often seem to give greater weight to loss - es than gains when making choices. That is, they are  often more reluctant to choose an outcome where  there is a chance of losing $100 than one where there  is the same chance of gaining the same amount — loss  aversion.24 This can account for the status quo bias,25  or the endowment effect, where people ask for more compensation to sell something they already own  than what they would be willing to pay if they did not  own it yet — a rational agent would have no reason to  value the same thing differently.26 A related behav - iour is probability weighting, where people attribute  a higher probability to events that have actually very  low probability of occurring (say, winning the lottery),  while assuming that events with very high probability  of occurring are less likely than they are in reality.27 Something that sociologists have emphasized for a  long time is that people often look at money as some - thing other than a fungible and homogeneous flow  of income. In many cases they construct mental ac - counts attributing different meanings and values to  different flows of income depending on factors rang - ing from how the money was earned to what it was  meant for.28 Money also serves different functions,  from offering for a sense of autonomy to being val - ued for the security that it provides for the future,  which can vary across cultural contexts and across  the income distribution.29 Finally  — and the list could  go on even for this narrow set of behaviours linked  to choice under uncertainty  — people tend to make  choices under what is called narrow framing.30 That  is, they do not evaluate all possible outcomes and  weigh them against one another but focus on one or  a few that are more salient for different reasons (be - cause they are surprising, say).31 To illustrate how this set of deviations from the  rational choice model can matter in the context of  changes to address the challenges discussed in this  Report, imagine the following scenario. A policy- maker shows how existing fossil fuel subsidies are  inefficient and regressive, are polluting the air and  could be phased out and replaced by income trans - fers or public spending on health and education, at  the same time giving incentives for less energy-in - tensive investments and innovations that help to fight  climate change.32 How would a behavioural agent look at the pro - posal? Possible deviations from rational choice (in - terlinked, not necessarily sequential and separate)  include the following. First, the subsidy becomes sali - ent (the agent might not even have known before that  something like this was in place) and a primary focus  of valuation (narrow framing). Second, the endow - ment effect would suggest that the behavioural agent  is not inclined to simply accept losing something she  CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 103 already has. Third, as appealing as the potential gains  from the policy are to the climate change–aware be - havioural agent, loss aversion can dominate, and the  prospective gains might not compensate for the pro - spective losses.33 Fourth, mental accounts mean that  all the money may already be destined for purposes  and goals from which the agent will not want to de - viate. Fifth, even though the policymaker is of unim - peachable integrity and very likely to follow through  with the compensation scheme, probability weight - ing could come to the fore, leading the behavioural  agent to believe that it is not that likely. “ Now widely recognized and accepted,  cognitive biases have opened a much  richer understanding of human behaviour  and a wider scope for the range of  policies and institutions that may be  considered beyond those that emanate  from the rational choice model At a minimum the behavioural agent could be ex - pected to be less supportive, if not outright oppose,  phasing out the fossil fuel subsidy, independent  of political economy and framing effects. In reali - ty, powerful economic interests seek to sway pub - lic opinion against removing fossil fuel subsidies to  keep their economic and political power,34 possibly  crafting narratives that build on some of these be - havioural insights. The scenario does not imply that  the behavioural agent is beyond the reach of reason:  each of the steps could be critically scrutinized, even  if this could be complex and cognitively demanding.  Nor is it inevitable that everyone will oppose the re - moval of fossil fuel subsidies  — quite the contrary, as  the discussion below suggests. This scenario is meant  simply to illustrate how a psychologically richer de - scription of behaviour under uncertainty opens space  to consider a wider scope beyond material incentives  to shape people’s choices.35 Now widely recognized and accepted, cognitive  biases (with reference to what would be expected  behaviour as a “rational” agent) and cognitive lim - itations (people are unable to process as much in - formation as would need to happen under a rational  choice model) have opened a much richer under - standing of human behaviour. This understanding  can widen the range of policies and institutions that may be considered beyond those that emanate from  the rational choice model. The implications contin - ue to be explored in fields ranging from optimal tax - ation36 to issues that draw on progress in behavioural  economics as an example of the “golden age of social  science.”37 Prospect theory (which accounts for sever - al of the biases associated with behaviour under un - certainty)38 has been used for insights from politics39  to international relations.40 This has inspired policy  interest in “nudging” or “priming” interventions that  preserve the freedom of choice but change the choice  architecture in ways that seek to “correct” for cogni - tive biases.41 These nonfiscal and nonregulatory ac - tions steer people to behave in a certain way but fully  preserve freedom of choice. One example is the Save  More Tomorrow initiative, behavioural interventions  nudging people to save more, whose principles have  been incorporated in the United States’ 2006 Pen - sion Protection Act.42 No single unified model accounts for all the docu - mented cognitive biases.43 So an intervention seek - ing to address one type of bias may affect behaviour  in a negative way elsewhere.44 Some behavioural in - terventions can even become too salient and back - fire, such as displaying death counts in street signs  to encourage safer driving, which has been shown to  increase car crashes.45 Nudges aim at intervening in  situations where people think fast and automatically,  implying that they make decisions in a different way  from when they are able to think slowly and reflec - tively.46 But this dichotomy may imply that opportu - nities are missed by recognizing that it is possible to  incorporate elements of reflection even in nudges47 or  to boost people’s ability to make decisions, enhanc - ing their agency in making choices.48 The effective - ness of nudges and boosts may also vary depending  on the cultural context.49 More than reviewing all relevant biases and their  implications, the purpose here is to suggest that cog - nitive biases and limitations often shape how people  behave, particularly in contexts of uncertainty. But  that behaviour, even if it deviates from what the ra - tional choice model predicts, does not imply that peo - ple are lacking in reason  — much of the behaviour may  actually be preferable, particularly to deal with un - certainty.50 Thus, awareness of these considerations  has heightened relevance when confronting uncer - tainties. A promising development with potentially  104 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 far-reaching policy implications is identifying funda - mental cognitive processes that can account for many  of the observed behavioural choices under uncertain - ty (spotlight 3.6). When emotions make preferences fickle The emotion of fear  — triggered by the belief of a  threat — tends to make people more risk averse, while  anger tends to make them more risk seeking.51 This  is just an example of how beliefs can change prefer - ences through emotions.52 Rational choice theory  assumes not only that beliefs and preferences both  matter but also that they are delinked. Emotions re - sult from gathering information, learning and ex - perience.53 Thinking and feeling are simultaneous  processes that cognitively shape an individual’s per - ception, attention, learning, memory, reasoning and  problem solving — affecting even the direction of cog - nitive biases. For instance, sadness  — growing glob - ally over the last decade, with more intensity among  the less educated  — often reverses the endowment  effect: when people are sad, choice prices exceed  selling prices (figure 3.2).54 Sadness can also height - en addictive substance use.55 In addition, anger can  account for major changes in political history that rational choice alone cannot explain,56 and emotions  more broadly can be decisive in accounts of historical  action and thought.57 Hope can lead to choices that  enhance health58 and mediate the relation between  income and subjective measures of wellbeing.59 The relevance of emotions seems to have deep  neuro-anatomical foundations, as seen in the way  people with different types of brain injuries make de - cisions.60 Recent neuroscience findings suggest that  rational decisionmaking may depend on prior accu - rate emotional processing.61 Even though some of the  specific findings may not be conclusive,62 a growing  body of evidence documents multiple ways that emo - tions matter when making choices,63 generating “the  rise of affectivism.”64 A full emotion-imbued model  of choice has been proposed.65 An instinctive sentiment of anger that can trig - ger a risky course of action  — which, in insight and  after critical reasoning is seen as harmful to oneself  or others  — can be dangerous. By contrast, emotions  are often triggered by reasoned understanding of  connections  — for instance, the cause of manifest in - justice that makes one angry about discrimination or  torture. Angry rhetoric in the writings of Mary Woll - stonecraft in the 19th century against the inequalities  suffered by women was followed by a strong appeal to  reason for the equality of rights of all human beings.66  Figure 3.2 People are experiencing more sadness 35 30 25 20 15Adult population experiencing sadness last day, by education level  (%, median across country values) 2005 2010 2015 2020Elementary school or less Less than tertiary education Tertiary complete Source: Human Development Report Office based on data from Gallup. CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 105 That emotions matter for behaviour is not, however,  a negation of rationality or reason or a justification for  not subjecting emotions to reasoned appraisal in the  same way that motivations and beliefs need to be. Motivated beliefs and motivated reasoning: When  more and better information may not be enough Preferences, goals and motivations can directly affect  beliefs, as a rapidly growing literature on motivated  beliefs and motivated reasoning documents  — people  distort how they process new information in the di - rection of beliefs they favour.67 In rational choice, be - liefs are based on rationally processing information,  and people cannot be systematically fooled. But be - liefs also fulfil psychological and other needs, with  implications for behaviour and choice. One example of motivated reasoning is wishful  thinking, which seems to have a positive valence  value, making people feel better and more optimistic  about the world, thus also having an emotional com - ponent. But it also has a functional value, allowing  people to persist in a task under adversity.68 Howev - er, it may also support dangerous behaviours, such as  persisting in smoking, believing that one’s health will  not be affected, despite all the scientific evidence to  the contrary.69 Beliefs about oneself or the world can persist de - spite information that would suggest (in a rational  choice model) the need to update beliefs. Such per - sistence can take place through many mechanisms  of self-deception or dissonance reduction.70 The pro - pensity to rationalize away evidence that clashes with  beliefs has been documented to be higher in some  instances for more analytically sophisticated and bet - ter educated individuals, so one cannot assume that  the importance of motivated cognition will decrease  as levels of education increase.71 Evidence also sug - gests that motivated reasoning is persistent in politi - cal leaders, who rely more on prior political attitudes  and less on new policy information than the general  public.72 Challenging beliefs that are deeply held be - cause they are associated with a person’s goals or  commitments  — for example, religious, moral or a  salient aspect of a person’s identity or politics  — can  trigger strong emotional responses of anger or even hate and disgust.73 Motivated reasoning can lead to  beliefs becoming more polarized around issues such  as immigration, income mobility and how to handle  crime.74 That is, some of the cleavages in beliefs are  tied not necessarily to material interests but to differ - ent worldviews or social identity. And when these ac - quire more salience, polarization can become more  correlated across issues, leading to “belief-value  constellations,”75 where people associate more with  a group based on shared ideas rather than economic  interests.76 “ Recognizing motivated beliefs can provide  a broader understanding not only of economic  choices but also of social and political  dynamics that cannot be accounted for by  assuming that voters and pressure groups  pursue their material self-interest and update  their beliefs on the basis of new evidence One illustration of the potential implications of  motivated reasoning is associated with (epistemic)  norms that shape what people consider to be true, in  addition to individual reasoning.77 Children at very  young age (age 4, with some rudimentary aspects  emerging during infancy) can determine beliefs that  are the norm in their context and identify false beliefs  — according to the prevailing social norm.78 Different  groups may assume different epistemic norms that  place different levels of trust on different sources of  information, institutions, experts and leaders. Indi - viduals may publicly reject or avoid certain behav - iours (for instance, attitudes towards vaccines or the  use of masks to avoid the spread of Covid-19)79 to sig - nal their commitment to a particular group and the  belief-value constellation that it holds.80 This may  “create a tension between epistemic norms that reli - ably lead to true beliefs and those that effectively per - form […] signaling functions associated with social  identity and group membership.”81 Thus, recognizing motivated beliefs can provide a  broader understanding not only of economic choices  but also of social and political dynamics that cannot  be accounted for by assuming that voters and pres - sure groups pursue their material self-interest and  update their beliefs on the basis of new evidence.82  Another very compelling application of motivated be - liefs could be how people may convince themselves  106 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 that climate change is not going to be too bad purely  because it helps them justify not taking action.83 Un - derstanding motivated reasoning provides a lens to  understand some dynamics of polarization noted in  chapter 1 and explored further in part II of the Re - port. How goals and values can motivate beliefs may  be relevant when we confront novel uncertainties  and particularly when there is a reversal in the impor - tance given in public debate to sentiments rather than  reasons. Since the 1980s there has been a reversal in  a trend dating from the mid-19th century of rational  language dominating sentiment-laden language in  fact-based argument (figure 3.3).84This evidence does not suggest that beliefs are  never or even infrequently updated based on new in - formation. But it shows how motivated cognition can  provide a richer understanding of human behaviour.85  It also shows that polarization should not be seen as  inevitable and preordained  — and that the affirma - tion of a more salient social identity, above all others,  should not be seen to uniquely define a person and  thus be accepted without scrutiny.86 Even more im - portant from a human development perspective, indi - vidual reasoning and public deliberation are powerful  drivers of social change  — people are not helpless pris - oners of one single social identity, of their emotions  Figure 3.3 The Great Reversal from rationality to sentiment in fact-based argument [average frequency of rationality word s] / [average frequency of intuition words] 0.40.60.81.01.2 A.

Indeed, harnessing diversity  of goals, motivations, values, beliefs and emotions  depends on how behaviours interact with institutions  and the procedures of social choice that can harness  plurality in productive ways, as explored next. Behavioural and institutional change:  Mobilizing human development  towards a hopeful future As argued earlier, behavioural changes and institu - tional reforms are interdependent. And the richer  understanding of human behaviour just reviewed  suggests much more scope for change in both than  may be commonly assumed. This is central to explore  how to draw from a context of uncertainty to mobilize  action towards a more hopeful future. That scope ex - pands even further with the understanding that cog - nitive biases and limitations are not hardwired and  universal to all humans in the same way87 — and are  not necessarily an inherent part of our psychology.88  Similarly, the role of emotions in changing preferenc - es and driving behaviour is also context contingent.  Emotions play a role in people’s conforming with so - cial norms, but the salience of doing so to avoid either  shame or guilt depends on the cultural context.89 It  has been argued that socialization and cultural con - text determine which emotions matter for behaviour  and how.90 And preferences and the motivations that  may drive certain beliefs  — across domains, from at - titudes towards risk to preferences for equity and in - come distribution  — vary widely across individuals  and across countries.91 Bringing culture back in: How the social context matters Recognizing culture (discussed below) is only part  of a broader and more fundamental point: the need  to give greater salience to how social contexts shape  preferences, perceptions and cognition  — not only  what people do but also who people believe they are.  That takes us from the rational agent and beyond the  behavioural agent to the encultured agent (see table  3.1).92 Recent insights from sociology have recon - ceptualized culture from something that stays in the  background of political and economic life towards  a much more dynamic, fluid and adaptable toolkit. This implies a two-way causal effect between cul - ture and institutions.93 It also means that people se - lect strategically from the toolkit to provide meaning,  interpretation and justification for their behaviour.94  Studies of poverty that focus on how scarcity taxes  people’s cognitive capacities and functions95 would  benefit from considering how people perceive and  identify needs based on what they take from the cul - tural toolkit available to them.96 When uncertainty  becomes salient, different groups of young people  buffer themselves against a murky future in differ - ent ways, drawing on the cultural toolkits available  to them.97 This perspective on culture is inspiring  fresh takes on economic development, exploring how  highly adaptable and fluid cultural configurations in - teract with political power and economic incentives  to generate different social, economic and political  outcomes.98 An emerging account of how cultural variation  takes hold comes from the field of cultural evolution,99  even if it remains a hotly debated perspective.100 In  this account psychological traits coevolve with the  broader cultural context in combinations that make  societies better adapted to different circumstanc - es over time.101 These perspectives also suggest that  what is assumed to be universal human behaviour is  often based on what is observed from a sliver of hu - manity.102 Thus, there is a much broader diversity of  behaviours, psychology and institutions across the  world and over time. And there is even more variation  within than across cultures.103 “ Recognizing culture is only part of a  broader and more fundamental point: the  need to give greater salience to how social  contexts shape preferences, perceptions  and cognition  — not only what people do  but also who people believe they are Culture, in these accounts, “represents informa - tion stored in people’s heads that got there through  cultural learning or direct experience induced by  various cultural products, like norms, technologies,  languages or institutions.”104 Cultures can vary in sys - tematic ways on dimensions ranging from how tight  cultural norms are enforced105 to how individualistic  they are.106 But cultures cannot be firmly categorized  in different boxes  — and even less so in dichotomous  108 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 ways, such as associating individualistic cultures with  “the West” and interdependent cultures with “the  East.”107 In cultural evolution accounts, cultural change is  driven largely by the emergence of culture and psy - chological traits that are better adapted to cope with  the new environment.108 Over time this has resulted  in culture-psychology combinations that have ena - bled people to cooperate at larger scales  — millions of  strangers in today’s societies  — devising specific social  arrangements (institutions, policies) resulting in ever  more complex and sophisticated technologies, lead - ing to higher income and material wellbeing.109 Cul - tural evolution is one way of accounting for changes  in moral values, with variations around the world as - sociated in part with how different societies have re - sponded to the problem of cooperation.110 A mismatch of behavioural patterns and  institutional settings in today’s uncertain times? Culture is both persistent, which helps people nav - igate and make decisions in their social world, and  changeable, particularly when that social world or the  environment around it is altered.111 When uncertainty  is heightened or changes, the potential for a cultural  mismatch increases between those relying on pre - vailing culture and those attempting to innovate to  adapt to the new circumstances.112 Cultural change  can play a role in how the social context influences  the emergence of behaviour and institutional config - urations. But as Amartya Sen argued: “Paying reflec - tive ethical attention to behaviour neither nullifies,  nor is nullified by, the importance of evolutionary  forces.”113 Ethical reasoning has been described as a  powerful way of “escaping from tribalism,” manifest  in patterns of moral progress that are less and less ex - clusionary of groups of people.114 It also offers oppor - tunities for norm-based governance to address global  collective action challenges, such as climate change.115 Evolutionary processes and ethical reasoning may  have interacted in reaching the current prevailing  configurations of behaviours and institutions. But  today’s uncertain times have novel elements that  present fundamentally new challenges, and those  configurations may not be a good match. Some of  the challenges of the Anthropocene are existential; others require cooperation not only with people alive  today but also with people who do not yet exist —  that is, with the future.116 The Anthropocene reality  of shared challenges at the planetary scale requires  cooperation  — or, at a minimum, coordination  —  across countries. “ There is tension between conforming to  the prevailing institutions (including norms)  and behaviours that have moved the world  towards record achievements in material  wellbeing  — and the lack of response from  those norms, institutions and behaviours  to a novel and unprecedented context Individual solutions for shared challenges can cre - ate tensions between self-reliance and collective effi - ciency. One country or group of people may be able to  afford to stay protected from a pandemic through pri - vate means. That can make cooperation and even co - ordination more difficult, in a modern tragedy of the  commons.117 Certainty about biophysical thresholds  of climate change and other dangerous patterns of  planetary change that would spell catastrophe would  make coordination by self-  interested agents more  likely. But great uncertainty about those thresholds  makes collective action less likely and harder.118 So, today’s uncertain times may be characterized  in part as a mismatch between the cultural configu - rations that have enabled certain development paths  thus far119 and the layered novel uncertainties of the  Anthropocene, transitions and polarization. Disa - greements and even conflict in societies may reflect  that mismatch. There is tension between conform - ing to the prevailing institutions (including norms)  and behaviours that have moved the world towards  record achievements in material wellbeing — and the  lack of response from those norms, institutions and  behaviours to a novel and unprecedented context. This mismatch could be playing out in many di - mensions. One has to do with generational inequal - ities in exposure to climate extremes. For the cohort  born in 1960, exposure to lifetime heat waves is es - sentially the same across climate change scenari - os. But even if temperatures stay below 1.5°C above  preindustrial levels, the cohort born in 2020 will  suffer four times more exposure  — and seven times  more under current pledges (figure 3.4). No surprise,  CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 109 then, that young people ages 16–25 around the world  report associating climate change with a range of  emotions with negative affect, from anger to anxie - ty: two-thirds report feeling sad, and two-thirds re - port feeling afraid.120 Another facet of disagreement  is the differences across groups of people in either  doubting or denying climate change. Groups in Eu - rope more concerned about their economic security  and less certain about the future are much more like - ly to reject climate change  — and to be “less prosper - ous, more rural and more economically dependent  on fossil fuels.”121 And individualistic attitudes are  associated with less concern for environmental ac - tion122 and less wearing of masks during the Covid-19  pandemic.123 The potential of this mismatch, and the broader  range of determinants of human behaviour beyond  rational and behavioural agents, also opens opportu - nities to mobilize uncertain times for better individ - ual and social outcomes. The insights from rational  choice and the emphasis on incentives remain rele - vant. Understanding how the context in the moment of decision influences choices, one of the insights of  behavioural science, and the role of emotions and  motivated reasoning widens the scope beyond incen - tives shaping the choices of self-interested agents.  But recognizing the role of culture further widens the  scope. It takes us beyond considering how interests  and institutions drive people’s behaviour, to recog - nize the power of ideas.124 Ideas with the power to shape individual and col - lective choice range from social identities and world - views125 to narratives and frames.126 Joel Mokyr has  emphasized “cultural entrepreneurs” as agents able  to change the beliefs of others during momentous  transformations in history, such as during the En - lightenment and the Industrial Revolution.127 Car - oline Schill and colleagues argue that this more  “dynamic understanding of human behaviour” is es - sential in the Anthropocene.128 This Report extends the argument to today’s un - certain times.129 It looks at current disagreements  and differences in perspective across groups of peo - ple less as a motive for despair and more as the kind  of diversity and pluralism that may be needed in an  open-ended pursuit of the innovations  — social, tech - nological, institutional  — required to respond to novel  and unprecedented challenges. In the “paradox of di - versity,” this pursuit may require longer lead times to  agree on collective actions and implement collective  decisions.130 As David Byrne sings: “The future is cer - tain; give us time to work it out.” This paradox gives  even more reason to address inequalities perceived  as unfair or divisive, while preserving the plurality of  views and an open, reasoned, public debate.131 Advancing human development to learn, and to  expand the scope for learning, in uncertain times Chapter 1 documented how novel layers of interact - ing uncertainties are heightening feelings of insecu - rity,132 pointing to a disconnect between wellbeing  achievements and security. What do we hold on to,  then, when even our sense of direction seems sub - merged in uncertainty? Wellbeing achievements with  insecurity and progress with polarization133 cast doubt  on seeing development as a smooth process of pro - gress in wellbeing achievements.

Our planet and  societies have gone through periods of change and  volatility before. But one key feature making this era  unique is humans’ role in driving threats  — and our  potential ability to shape the changes to build a more  hopeful future (spotlight 3.7).135 A real paradox of our  time is our tentativeness to act despite mounting evi - dence of the distress that our pursuit of development  is inflicting on our societies and planet. One contri - bution of this Report is to explore how understanding  uncertainty and its relation to individual and collec - tive choices can explain why action may be delayed,  even in the face of looming threats, and to suggest  ways forward that move us beyond paralysis.136 Why might societies not adequately respond to  uncertainty? Consider the interaction between the  different multilayered uncertainties and both behav - iour and institutions (figure 3.5). Societies respond  to shocks through multiple institutional and policy  mechanisms. These institutions are often designed  to absorb the shocks and moderate the threats that  people confront. Under the rational choice model this  process depends on state capacity, resource distribu - tion and social preferences, as with the way societies manage the potential tensions between social insur - ance and individual responsibility.137 Now consider how social arrangements (insti - tutions and policies) are influenced by a wider set  of individual and social factors interacting with an  evolving reality. In the presence of new threats, peo - ple’s behaviour is strongly mediated by their per - ceived uncertainty.138 This perception comes through  different channels. First is the increase in residual  uncertainty, the one not absorbed by the collective  response. Second is the perceived adequacy of the  social response and the extent to which previous be - liefs about how things work hold, which determines  confidence in institutions and trust within and across  groups. Third is the social and cultural context that  defines the interpretation of the new threats in the  light of prevailing narratives. Is it a sign of personal  failure? Will this affect my position and future pros - pects in society?139 Fourth are the emotions surround - ing the increased uncertainty, ranging from fear to  indifference to hope. The same shock can thus cause  different levels of perceived individual uncertainty,  depending on the prevailing narratives about under - lying processes and the perceived effectiveness of  policies. Uncertainty for individuals shapes both individu - al behaviour and attitudes, with an impact on social  interactions.

CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 111 are perceived as ineffective or unfair can trigger an - imosity and polarization  — especially in the presence  of political narratives that manipulate the situation to  deepen societal divides.140 Such polarization has been  documented in several countries in the response to  the Covid-19 pandemic,141 where the public health  measures put in place were resisted less because of  a personal assessment of risks of, for instance, being  vaccinated, and more because they represented a set  of behaviours that defined expected group behav - iours. Disbelief in climate change is associated more  with political allegiance than with misinformation.142  This animosity and polarization then drive not only  the specific collective response but also how the col - lective response interacts with the threat, eventually  heightening uncertainty. Thus, the high and in many  cases rising perceptions of insecurity may be ac - counted for in this type of uncertainty loop. Expanding human development to foster  learning and public reasoning The broader understanding of human behaviour  highlighted in this chapter helps account for some of  the choices that so many people are making around  the world, resulting in patterns ranging from political  polarization to the rejection or dilution of the science  of climate change and pandemics. But understand - ing does not mean resignation. Recognizing the role  of emotions does not mean that we should wait until  catastrophic outcomes become emotionally salient to  act. Events that become salient and emotionally res - onant can drive action, sometimes in directions that  were thought to be unthinkable before that event.143  But the layers of uncertainty described in chapter 1  imply that we have no option other than to think  ahead and act with a sense of urgency, since in many  cases we will not have second chances.144 And understanding that people are often prey to  motivated reasoning and hold steadfast to beliefs  that are hard to dislodge145 is no reason to not scruti - nize reasons and beliefs. Subjecting prevailing beliefs  and alleged reasons to critical examination, through  appropriately comprehensive processes (see below)  and with relevant information, can result in objective  beliefs. Indeed, research has shown that uncertain - ty about other people’s political beliefs and attitudes can drive people to tighten their own beliefs.146 Be- cause people often misconceive others’ attitudes and  values, polarization may be cemented in spaces and  on issues where differences in attitudes or opinions  are, in fact, fairly small.147 This so-called “false polar - ization” has been found to drive actual political po - larization.148 Understanding the processes that create  misconceptions opens space for interventions that  may correct them and mitigate political polarization.149 “ Subjecting prevailing beliefs and  alleged reasons to critical examination,  through appropriately comprehensive  processes and with relevant information,  can result in objective beliefs This scrutiny of reasons and beliefs should happen  at the individual level, but here we have to be mindful  also of the cognitive limitations and biases discussed  earlier in the chapter (see also spotlight 3.6). That is  why public reasoning — always important under any  circumstances  — acquires heightened relevance in to - day’s world. Our individual brains are limited, but our  collective brain150 is far more powerful. A plurality of  sources of voice and power is not a weakness in to - day’s uncertain times but can be a source of strength,  provided processes sustained by democratic practic - es ensure that public reasoning takes place in a con - text and through processes where what carries the  day is not always a powerful economic or political  group or a highly motivated believer who refuses to  subject beliefs to critical examination.151 Processes of  democratic practice, at multiple scales, need to also  avoid parochial dominance and welcome perspec - tives from “impartial spectators” — that is, the views  of people who may not be part of a particular political  jurisdiction. And given that the novel layers of uncer - tainty have planetary relevance, the role of multilat - eralism becomes more relevant than ever.152 So what to do? Part II of the Report addresses this  question, but as part I closes, it is important to reaf - firm the central argument of this chapter, that dou - bling down on human development is not only the  central aspiration but also the means to navigate un - certain times and effect the behavioural changes and  institutional reforms that would allow us to shape  a more hopeful future. Advancing human develop - ment means pursuing all aspects of capabilities, not  112 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 just the drive to enhance wellbeing achievements.  Agency matters, as do freedoms in both wellbeing  and agency  — options that need to remain wide as  the search for the appropriate set of institutions and  behaviours is still open-ended. In a sense expand - ing human development in uncertain times can also  be a learning process, where capabilities  — wellbeing  and agency, achievements and freedoms  — allow for  changes in behaviour and institutions to take shape  in addition to expanding the scope for learning. Con - fronting the layers of uncertainty that we face today is about enhancing cooperation at multiple scales  and about the “agility of the mind” to use new and  appropriate frames to understand our world and the  responses needed to address the challenges that we  confront.153 Part II of the Report proposes motivating princi - ples whose cultivation can enable public reasoning,  as well as priority policy areas, so that human devel - opment is advanced in a way that enables people to  harness uncertainty towards a more hopeful world  —  more just for people living now and in the future. CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 113 Agency is the ability to hold values and make com - mitments that may  — or may not — advance the per - son’s wellbeing.1 The person may be committed to  fighting climate change to an extent that she skips  school or forgoes a well-paying job, choices that  may not advance wellbeing but would express agen - cy. Another important distinction is between actual  achievements and the options or freedoms available  to people, regardless of their choices. Independent of  what people end up securing, the options or freedoms  available to people are inherently valuable.2 These distinctions result in four aspects of capabil - ities of interest: • Achievements in wellbeing. • Achievements in agency. • Freedoms in wellbeing. • Freedoms in agency.3 In assessing development progress, the spotlight  tends to shine more on wellbeing achievements, such  as standards of living, and much less on the freedoms  available to people and their agency.4 But these four aspects of capabilities are relevant  in the context of drawing on the human development  approach to support behavioural change and insti - tutional reform to navigate today’s uncertain times.  Chapters 1 and 2 suggest the need to go beyond  —  not replace  — considering wellbeing achievements  alone  — for two reasons. First, the spotlight on well - being achievements may leave other aspects of life  that matter to people in the shadows  — such as feeling very or increasingly insecure, despite high wellbeing  achievements. Second, there is no guarantee that fo - cusing on wellbeing achievements alone would equip  people with the capabilities to navigate today’s un - certain times  — and particularly to lead fundamental  transformational change to adapt and transition away  from the layers of novel uncertainty that characterize  today’s world. Freedoms and agency have always been intrinsical - ly important. They are also instrumentally important,  as in facilitating collective action to provide public  goods.5 And they may be indispensable where soci - eties have to explore largely uncharted transitions to  an aspirational space of expanding human develop - ment while easing planetary pressures.6 Human development, understood as expanding  the four aspects of capabilities, thus becomes both  the end and the means. Agency acquires relevance  because it is difficult, if not impossible, to conceive  of people leading the required transformations if they  are seen only as potential receivers of assistance, as  simply “vehicles of wellbeing,”7 as mere patients  —  rather than as agents able to judge, to commit and to  give priority to goals and values that may go beyond  advancing their wellbeing. Recognizing agency af - firms people not only as the subject of wellbeing- or  welfare- enhancing policies (though these are im - portant) but also as active promoters and catalysts of  social and economic change8 — beyond their own nar - row self-interest.SPOTLIGHT 3.1 How agency differs from wellbeing 114 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 NOTES 1 Sen (1985) suggested that the neglect of agency is shadowed by the  consideration that people are geared exclusively to purse their material  self-interest. 2 Sen (1985) argued that the neglect of options results from assuming that  only actual achievements, or what people end up choosing, counts. See  Sen (1999) for an elaboration on the perspective of seeing development  as freedom. This refers primarily to what Sen called opportunity freedoms,  recognizing that process freedoms, some of which may not be associated  with capabilities, also matter. 3 The original framing around these four categories of capabilities was pro - posed in Sen (1985). The discussion here, including the examples, draws  mainly from the simplified treatment in Sen (2009b). 4 These four aspects of capability often reinforce one another but need  not. For instance, being well nourished is certainly something important  for human life and part of the wellbeing aspect of capabilities. But some - times a commitment to fasting (for religious or political reasons), which  is in the realm of the agency aspect of capabilities, may override the  overwhelming importance that being well-nourished has for most people,  most of the time. And while the state should have an obligation to ensure that everyone has the freedom to be well-nourished, just because the  wellbeing achievement of being well-nourished matters does not imply  that the state should ban fasting. That would be a limitation not only in  people’s freedoms in wellbeing achievements, by precluding the pos - sibility of choosing not to eat, but also in their agency, by excluding the  possibility of making a commitment to fasting (Sen 1985). 5 Shi and others 2020. 6 In standard rational choice theory models, discussed later in the chapter,  temporal-dependent and context-dependent preferences are often seen  as suboptimal deviations from normative choice. But recent evidence  shows how adaptation of preferences is crucial for efficiently representing  information in volatile and uncertain contexts: “Value adaptation confers  distinct benefits to a decision maker in a dynamic world” (Khaw, Glimcher  and Louie 2017, p. 2700). 7 Sen 2009b, p. 288. 8 Indeed, civil society organizations, community initiatives, social move - ments and activists around the world work tirelessly using their agency to  bring about social change. CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 115 SPOTLIGHT 3.2 Agency, ideas and the origins of the  regulatory welfare state Elisabeth Anderson,  New York University Abu Dhabi Can an individual change the course of policy histo - ry? Might such individuals be motivated by shared  ideas from which they do not stand to directly bene - fit? The answer to both questions, I argue in my recent  book, Agents of Reform: Child Labor and the Origins  of the Welfare State,  is a qualified yes. Under certain  conditions, and only with cooperation from others,  individual middle-class reformers exercised deci - sive influence over early legislation to protect work - ers. Acting on culturally embedded ideas about why  industrial labour conditions were problematic, they  exercised creative agency to build political coalitions  and surmount institutional barriers to change. At a  time when labour still lacked the power to demand  protective legislation on its own, these reformers de - serve much of the credit for bringing the regulatory  welfare state into being. Regulatory welfare refers to the web of policies  that protect workers by limiting employers’ arbitrary  power over them. Child labour laws enacted in the  1830s and 1840s were the first of these efforts to in - tervene in the relationship between the new industrial  bourgeoisie and the “free” labour it employed. These  laws formed the bedrock on which vital protections  for adult workers  — including occupational health and  safety regulations as well as the normal working day  —  were eventually built. Still, scholars tend to pay little  attention to this regulatory side of the welfare state.  Agents of Reform aims to correct this through seven  case studies of the political origins of child labour and  factory inspection legislation in 19th century Belgium,  France, Germany and the United States. Throughout much of the 19th century, work - ing-class people were politically marginalized. In  many countries they could not even vote. Moreo - ver, many workers did not regard child labour as a  problem requiring legislative attention; some de - pended on their children’s earnings to survive, and  others were more focused on issues of direct con - cern to adult men. Under these conditions it was middle-class reformers who spearheaded efforts to  enact child labour laws and later to create the factory  inspection systems needed to enforce them. One puzzle is why these reformers bothered to put  time and energy into advocating for policies from  which they themselves did not stand to directly ben - efit. Understanding this requires excavating the ideas  that motivated them  — and these, it turns out, were  surprisingly diverse. Ideologically, child labour and  factory inspection reformers ran the gamut from clas - sical liberalism to religious conservatism to demo - cratic socialism. What united them, however, was  the belief that excessive and premature labour inflict - ed lasting damage on children’s minds, bodies and  souls. Allowing such abuses to continue posed a dire  threat, not only to working-class children’s wellbeing  but also to the nation as a whole. How they interpret - ed this threat varied. For instance, some saw child  workers as potential criminals or revolutionaries who  required the disciplining influence of school, where - as other regarded them as national resources whose  human capital was being squandered. Ideas such as  these informed reformers’ understandings of the  child labour problem and drove them to pursue leg - islation. They were not, at least not in a direct sense,  motivated by simple self-interest. Of course, not all would-be reformers were equal - ly influential. They needed allies. Scrutinizing how  some succeeded while others did not reveals that ef - fective reformers distinguished themselves in two  ways: alliance-building and problem solving. Alliance-building Reformers used a variety of alliance-building  strategies  — including framing, citation, piggyback - ing, compromise and expertise-signalling — in ways  that accorded with the priorities and expectations  of the audiences they needed to convince. Take the  116 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 first of these strategies: frames are ideas that political  actors deploy to convert audiences into allies. To be  effective, frames must resonate with audience mem - bers’ existing ideas or interests; otherwise, they will  fall flat and can even backfire.1 To illustrate this, compare how two reformers  — one  successful, one not — framed the child labour problem  at key coalition-building moments. When Charles  Dupin, a French legislator, argued before the Cham - ber of Peers that child labour rendered “the country  weak in military powers, and poor in all the occupa - tions of peace,”2 he was cleverly framing the issue  as vital to France’s economic and national security  interests. He went on to argue that working children  were likely to grow up to be criminals and deviants  who would destabilize the social order. Such frames  appealed directly to the concerns of political elites  and helped Dupin build a solid coalition around his  proposed child labour bill. In contrast, when Édouard Ducpétiaux, a Belgian  public administrator, framed child labour as a grave  violation of children’s rights, his argument was soon  used against him by chambers of commerce that  were institutionally empowered to weigh in on eco - nomic legislation  — and whose support Ducpétiaux  needed to move forward. The notion that children  had rights that sometimes trumped those of fathers  had not yet been established by law or custom, so the  employers accused Ducpétiaux of trying to upend the  sacred privileges of the pater familias in a misguided  pursuit of “foreign” policy goals. Missteps such as  these contributed to Ducpétiaux’s failure as a child  labour reformer and, by extension, to Belgium’s ina - bility to enact child labour regulation until much later  in the 19th century. Problem solving The second way successful reformers distinguished  themselves was through their willingness to try cre - ative, and at times risky, problem-solving strategies.  When political opponents repeatedly impeded their reform ambitions, they reacted by subverting nor - mal policymaking channels in unconventional ways.  For example, when Theodor Lohmann, a Prussian  commerce ministry official, found his quest for a Re - ich-wide system of factory inspection thwarted at  every turn by his formidable boss, Otto von Bismarck,  he refused to give up. Instead, he went behind the  chancellor’s back, penning anonymous op-ed arti - cles to drum up support, enlisting friends to lobby  their political contacts and, most decisively, secretly  sharing his own factory inspection bill with leaders of  Germany’s second most powerful political party. By  forging an unauthorized and highly risky alliance with  the legislative branch, Lohmann was eventually able  to harness the Reichstag’s power and circumvent Bis - marck’s executive authority. Without Lohmann’s bold  interventions, Germany would not have been able  to mandate factory inspections across the empire, at  least not until after the end of Bismarck’s reign. *   *   * Research on agency and policy change often high - lights policy or institutional entrepreneurs and  stresses that these actors are first and foremost coa - lition-builders.3 My analysis builds on this literature  by specifying various micro-level relational strategies  through which reformers forge alliances and over - come institutional barriers. In doing so, it lends pre - cision to the general claim that their agency matters.  It shows, furthermore, that 19th century labour pro - tections were not simply the outcome of dedicated  reformers’ compassion or morality. Rather, protec - tions were enacted when reformers persuaded law - makers that working children posed hidden threats,  or harboured latent resources, that were relevant to  the interests of elites and the state. At a time when  labour’s political power has eroded and policy pro - gress still requires substantial buy-in from political  elites, these insights remain relevant for social wel - fare reformers today.

CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 117 An agent (someone who acts) makes a rational choice  when acting to do as well as she believes she can to  achieve her preferences.1 There are three independ - ent ingredients in rational choice: stable preferenc - es, rational information processing and beliefs, and  maximization.2 What someone desires (preferences)  is autonomous and does not change. It is what moves  people to pursue their individual self-interest, their  own wellbeing (their utility). They form their be - lief based on information collected to help the agent  make a specific decision. For instance, if someone  prefers not to get wet after leaving the house, how  does she choose whether to grab an umbrella? Ra - tional choice assumes that she makes the decision  based on the combination of the preference (to not  get wet) and the belief about whether it is going to  rain  — for instance, by looking out the window or con - sulting weather forecasts, depending on how impor - tant it is for her to not get wet.3 This concept of agent is very general and is widely  used to describe and explain human behaviour with  economic models,4 framing rational choice as max - imizing individual welfare (typically represented by  a utility function that translates consumption choic - es into welfare).5 Preferences are thus represented  by a utility function that each person seeks to maxi - mize. Powerful extensions account for more general  contexts. When two or more agents are in a situation  where their choices depend on what others do, they  need to form rational expectations (that is, assume  that everyone else behaves according to rational  choice) about what the others will do. This type of  interdependent decisionmaking is studied in game theory, which can be applied to many economic, polit - ical and social settings. More relevant for this Report,  where there is uncertainty  — that is, where different  outcomes are possible, each with a different level of  utility associated with it — the model is reframed as  expected utility theory. The utility (which represents  the agent’s preferences) associated with each possible  outcome is weighed by its probability of occurring and  averaged out in the form of expected utility, which  then represents what the agent seeks to maximize. Under well-specified conditions (for instance,  everyone has access to the same information), eco - nomic agents make choices for what to consume and  produce, exchanging what they are endowed with in  markets, leading to an economic equilibrium that is  reached after all the agents make their best possible  choice in fulfilling their individual motivations.6 The  economic equilibrium is such that no agents can im - prove their utility without harming someone else’s   — designated as Pareto optimality. These results are  often the justification for many policies and insti - tutions. Their scope is justified as correcting viola - tions of the conditions under which this equilibrium  emerges (that is, correcting market failures, ranging  from externalities, when choices have side effects  that are not included in the moment of choice, to sit - uations in which some agents have more information  than others). Policies and institutions often focus  on structuring incentives  — changing prices through  taxes, for instance, to bring the actual conditions  under which people make choices closer to the speci - fied conditions under which the model yields the de - sired Pareto optimum equilibrium.SPOTLIGHT 3.3 The “rational” agent and rational choice theory 118 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 NOTES 1 The description of rational choice in this spotlight draws heavily from  Elster (2021b). A more extensive treatment is presented in Elster (2015). 2 A canonical statement comes from Becker (1976, p. 143): “all human be - haviour can be viewed as involving participants who maximize their utility,  form a stable set of preferences and accumulate an optimal amount of  information and other inputs in a variety of markets.” 3 The example also comes from Elster (2021b). 4 Much of the inspiration for the discussion in this spotlight comes from Hoff  and Stiglitz (2016). 5 A set of axioms that are behaviourally plausible and impose a logical struc - ture to the acts of choice that are allowed to take place is also included  (for example, if someone prefers apples to oranges and oranges to pears,  she also has to prefer apples to pears). For a formal treatment, includ - ing some of the extensions discussed in this paragraph, see Mas-Colell,  Whinston and Green (1995). Key axioms are meant to ensure behaviour where there is consistency of choice, but Sen (1993) argued that seem - ingly inconsistent behaviours do not imply lack of rationality, since they  may reflect the consistent use of decision strategies based on rules. Sen  (2002) argued that there is no way to establish internal consistency of  choice without referring to something external to the act of choice (such  as values or norms). Arkes, Gigerenzer and Hertwig (2016) argue that  coherence in choice cannot be a universal benchmark of rationality. 6 The model formalizes Adam Smith’s intuition that the pursuit of self-interest  in the context of potentially mutually beneficial economic exchange would  make everyone better off, without the need for moral commitments to do - ing something good or under the direction of a supra-individual authority.  It is ironic that Adam Smith is remembered primarily for this insight, when  much of his work was to explore the importance of different motivations  for human behaviour, including the role of moral commitments or social  expectations about what is acceptable behaviour. These observations  draw from Sen (2009b). CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 119 In unsettled times the perpetual question of how  human societies can progress takes on new forms.  This Report diagnoses the multiple sources of inse - curity and distress affecting so many people around  the world at present and in doing so explores some  possible actions policymakers might take. Even set - ting aside immediate pressures such as conflict-relat - ed food shortages and price increases, two long-term  challenges face all of us. One is dealing with the con - sequences of climate change. The other is responding  to the structural economic and social changes being  brought about by disruptive digital technologies. A  long time in the making, both need action now, or  they will increase inequalities and insecurities be - yond the intolerable levels they have already reached. Tackling these challenges will require new ana - lytical tools. This is because the phenomena of en - vironmental damage on the one hand and digital  transformation on the other do not conform to the as - sumptions underlying much conventional economic  analysis and policy recommendations. Both areas are  rife with what economists refer to as externalities or  spillovers, whereby decisions have byproducts in the  form of substantial consequences for others as well  as the decisionmaker. Examples are businesses that  emit pollutants or carbon dioxide, causing environ - mental and societal damage they do not have to pay  for, or in the digital domain the provision of personal  data that reveal information about other individuals   — or conversely that enable platforms to provide a  better service to all their users. Environmental exter - nalities are usually negative, as natural resources are  so often unpriced. Digital externalities can be either  negative or positive. In textbook economics the rule of thumb is that  market prices capture the relevant information for  the best use and allocation of resources; but it is also  textbook economics that this presumption does not  hold when there are pervasive externalities. On the contrary such situations of market failure pose col - lective action problems. Individual incentives lead to  worse outcomes than are possible if there is coordina - tion, led by either governments and public bodies or  community-organized institutions, as in the inspiring  work of Elinor Ostrom. Yet although this is well known, standard econom - ic policy tools continue to assume a simpler world  where it can be reasonably believed that individual  business or personal decisions generally lead to good  economic outcomes, while individual market failures  can be tackled one by one with specific solutions. This  default way of thinking about economic policy, deep - ly embedded in the education and traditions of pol - icymakers for decades, needs to change. The world  has changed beyond recognition from those mental  models of individual choice. To give one example, digital business models using  data and algorithms to deliver services are becom - ing increasingly widespread in many countries. They  hold great promise for individual consumers  — for  example, enhancing access to low-cost financial ser - vices or providing access to markets for small and  medium enterprises. But they need an appropriate  policy framework to govern their use of data and en - sure markets remain open for new entrants. Data are a key resource in the digital economy, but  data’s features are not like a standard economic good.  Data are “nonrival” in that they can be used by many  people simultaneously and are not depleted, and data  can cause harm (a negative externality) by uninten - tionally revealing too much information about people  at the expense of their privacy and offer benefits (pos - itive externalities) when different pieces of data are  joined to provide useful information. Businesses that  acquire a lot of data about users can also turn those  data into a barrier to entry to limit their competition,  as they are in a much better position to both improve  service and earn revenues.SPOTLIGHT 3.4 How can societies make progress in  uncertain times? A question taking on new  forms, calling for new analytical tools Diane Coyle,  Cambridge University. 120 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 Since 2019 the debate about competition policy  has increasingly recognized the challenge posed by  the dominance of a few companies in digital markets,  which are sometimes described as “winner takes all”  or “superstar” markets. However, progress in chang - ing policies to tackle market dominance has been  slow, even in the United Kingdom and the United  States, where the academic and policy debate started  a few years ago. The everyday, practical policy tools  for analysis and remedies do not yet exist. What is more, debates about appropriate govern - ance policies for data more generally are in their  early stages. Should data be “owned” as if a piece of  property when the information that data provide is al - ways relational or contextual? If so, given that using  data creates so much value, who should be assigned  property rights: the collector or the original subject or  source? If not, what framework of access rights and  responsibilities would generate value for society?  How should data users be required to take account of  data bias due to the inequality of society  — and indeed  of people who have no data “voice,” whose activities  and needs are not measured? Another example of an area with many open ques - tions, due to the absence so far of an appropriate  benchmark policy framework, is biodiversity policies.  Partha Dasgupta’s 2020 landmark review of the eco - nomics of biodiversity for Her Majesty’s Treasury in the United Kingdom synthesized the relevant theo - retical framework, but again the spadework needs  to be done to turn conceptual insights into practical  interventions. How can early warning of irreversible  tipping points in ecosystems be recognized? What is  the appropriate geographic scope for measuring and  acting on biodiversity loss? How does it integrate  with agricultural productivity or affect human health? In both arenas, environmental and digital, there  has been considerable excellent academic research at  the frontier of knowledge. But to turn this into action - able insights, the default presumption needs to be  that this is a world of tipping points, multiple possible  outcomes depending on current choices, external - ities and collective action problems. The economic  analysis needs to be integrated with scientific or tech - nical knowledge to deliver practical policy tools. Dif - ferent datasets are required, going beyond standard  economic metrics and dashboards. There are active debates among researchers and  policymakers alike about these kinds of challenges  and much recent progress  — such as the development  of statistical standards for measuring natural capital  and ecosystem services. But shaping an appropriate  mindset for this uncertain, unstable and intercon - nected world remains a challenge. Source: Based on Coyle (2021). CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 121 SPOTLIGHT 3.5 Norms and cooperation in a multipolar  world: Beyond economics Kaushik Basu,  Cornell University As the world battles multiple onslaughts  — from the  fracturing of society, caused by the shifting rules of  economic and social interaction, in turn caused by  the rapid advance in digital technology, to the rise  in climate-related disasters, the Covid-19 pandem - ic that waxes and wanes but refuses to go, and to the  war in Ukraine  — it is time to rethink not just our pol - icies but also the foundations of the social sciences.  Since much of today’s policy challenge relates to eco - nomics, economists have written extensively on these  themes, much of it captured in this Report. There is,  however, a growing contribution from neighbouring  disciplines  — philosophy, politics and sociology  — that  provide insights for economists and urge them to  question some of the assumptions hidden deep in the  woodwork of their own discipline. It is important to  realize that the world that we analyse is partly a con - struction of our discipline.1 As we try to understand  society, which is on the one hand steadily globalizing  and on the other becoming politically polarized with  rising conflict across and within nations, it is critical  to trespass boundaries and draw on these alternate  disciplinary paradigms. Since the Age of Enlightenment, and even before  that, philosophers have been aware of the need for  society to nurture cooperation. Some of this hap - pens naturally from the nudges of the invisible  hand, but we also need agreements and conventions  that coordinate the behaviours of individuals. Such  agreements seem like an impossible task for our  vast, multipolar world. Hope lies in the fact that we  now have a better understanding of how coopera - tion happens and why it often breaks down. This is  because of one instrument that the Enlightenment  philosophers did not have but their progenies do, to  wit, game theory. As a result, there has been a spate  of recent writing that formalizes ideas from the  17th and 18th centuries and helps us think of new  ways to manage society, avert conflict and foster  development.2This new literature is helping us grapple with real-   world problems, from conflict and social inequality to  the role of political leaders. We understand these bet - ter than ever before. How do leaders acquire power?  Why do they have such influence over individuals, at  times hurting the very people who follow them? Sur - prisingly, much of the leader’s ability to stir action  among people arises from nothing but the beliefs  of ordinary individuals. The statements and orders  of the leader create focal points. You believe that,  given a leader’s order or suggestion of order, others  will follow it, and that in turn makes it in your inter - est to follow it as well. When such a confluence of be - liefs occurs, a speech or even an utterance by a leader  can unleash torrents of behaviour among individu - als, propped up by nothing more than beliefs of what  other individuals will do. This kind of analysis can be brought to bear on  practical matters, such as the responsibility people  bear towards their community3 and a leader’s respon - sibility for the behaviour of his or her followers. The  convention is to hold a leader responsible for certain  group behaviour if it can be shown that unleashing  such behaviour was the leader’s intention. Follow - ing the above analysis, it can be argued that a lead - er should also be held responsible for unwarranted  group behaviour if the leader could reasonably be  shown to have been aware that his or her speech or  behaviour would result in the group behaviour, even  if that was not the leader’s intention.4 This altered  view can have large implications for how we interpret  the law, regulate and punish. Because of the large influence of economists, much  of the formal analysis remains confined to individually  rational behaviour. We try to explain all forms of coop - eration by reference to self-interest. This often leads to  exciting mathematical models, but one consequence  of this obsession is we forget that universal self-in - terested behaviour is one of those assumptions in the  woodwork, which we take for granted but is not true. 122 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 Virtually all human beings carry some form of  moral compasses in their heads. They desist from  numerous behaviours not out of self-interest but be - cause their ethics, often deontological principles, do  not permit them. I believe we do not pick other peo - ple’s pockets not because, after doing a cost-benefit  analysis, we conclude that the cost of picking pockets  outweighs the benefit, but because this is an inbuilt  moral code in us. This, in turn, raises questions about the very mean - ing of cooperation. Was the cooperation of Adam  Smith the same as that of philosophers and scholars  of politics?5 Basing our evaluation on a wider disci - plinary foundation also raises vital questions about  value, worth and equality. We can stigmatize individ - uals, banish individuals to the margins and exacer - bate inequities in a variety of ways.6 These inequities  can give rise to fractures and polarizations that have  little to do with economic inequality. Because these are subjects on the fringes of the  social sciences, we know little about the connection  between the nature of norms and moral codes we  adhere to and the level of our economic growth and wellbeing. There is need for more research on this. It  is arguable that to sustain economic development, we  need concurrent moral progress. Michele Moody-Ad - ams argues that what is moral “progress” can be  contested, but we can nevertheless take a stance on  it, and she expressed optimism that moral progress  can be advanced.7 Allen Buchanan and Russell Pow - ell take the agenda forward, showing that this can be  carried over to codes of inclusivity, which are critical - ly important in today’s polarized world.8 As we understand these motivations that go be - yond individual rationality, we can try to cultivate  moral instincts that lead to greater harmony and co - operation in society. The crux of the challenge is to  think of codes of behaviour that individuals as well as  collectivities such as nations adhere to. The aim is to  have agreements, such as minimal constitutions, that  are scientifically constructed. This will not rule out  conflict since the roots of some conflicts go beyond  self-interest.9 Nevertheless, by nurturing certain  codes of behaviour, which are often innately in us an - yway, we can hope to stimulate empathy and further  the collective good for the world.

CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 123 SPOTLIGHT 3.6 Cognitive uncertainty Benjamin Enke,  Harvard University Many of the most important challenges facing human - kind require tradeoffs involving uncertainty and time.  For instance, climate change mitigation measures  are risky in the sense that we do not know precisely  how well they will work. Moreover, climate action in - volves intertemporal tradeoffs because it delivers ben - efits primarily in the future but accrues costs today.  In contexts like these, adequate decisionmaking by  policymakers and individuals requires sophisticated  reasoning about risk and time. Yet, a key insight from  recent research in behavioural economics is that many  economically relevant decisions that involve risk or  intertemporal tradeoffs are cognitively very difficult.  Consider the following two illustrative examples: • Suppose you are offered an investment that pays  $1,000 with a probability of 35 percent and nothing  with a probability of 65 percent. How much would  you be willing to pay for such an asset? Maybe  $220? Are you sure? How about $185? Or $342? • Now suppose you actually won $1,000 and your  banker offers you a safe annual interest rate of  4 percent. How much of your new wealth would you  like to save at this interest rate rather than spend  this year? $600? Are you sure? Not $775 or $452? These examples illustrate a principle that is very gen - eral: in a large range of decisions, people exhibit cogni - tive uncertainty, meaning that they do not know which  decision is actually best for them, given their prefer - ences. Cognitive uncertainty refers to a purely internal   — cognitive  — form of uncertainty, rather than objective  uncertainty about the physical world. Cognitive un - certainty is the result of people’s imperfect ability to  determine the optimal course of action in complex sit - uations. The empirical reality that people often exhibit  cognitive uncertainty contrasts with the approach tra - ditionally taken by behavioural economists, which is  to assume that people may make mistakes but are not  aware of their own cognitive imperfections.1 Why is cognitive uncertainty important? A main  reason is that a growing number of experiments and surveys document that when people are cognitive - ly uncertain, they anchor on a so-called cognitive  default decision.2 A cognitive default decision is the  naïve decision people would make in the absence of  any deliberation: what they would do if they did not  really think about it. In contexts with which people  have experience, this could be a decision they pre - viously made. In contexts with which people do not  have experience, the cognitive default is often to pick  something intermediate or a compromise. Regard - less of what the decision is, much evidence shows  that when people are cognitively uncertain, they an - chor on, or regress to, a cognitive default.3 As a result,  people’s decisions are often poorly calibrated to the  prevailing set of circumstances, in particular under  new environmental conditions. The following sections explore these abstract ideas  in more concrete contexts, by studying how people  think about probabilities (uncertainty) and intertem - poral tradeoffs and then by discussing more spec - ulatively how cognitive uncertainty and cognitive  default decisions may matter for understanding and  addressing current societal challenges. Decisionmaking under uncertainty Almost all economically relevant decisions involve  some risk. As a result, much research in economics  and psychology studies how people learn from in - formation, how they make predictions about future  events (such as the probability that they will lose their  job) and how they choose among different invest - ment strategies (such as whether and how to invest in  the stock market). All these domains require people  to process probabilities. Yet, substantial research has  documented that people have a pronounced tendency  to make decisions that look as if they implicitly treat  all probabilities to some degree alike, which produces  a compression-to-the-centre effect (figure S3.6.1).4 124 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 The left panel of figure S3.6.1 shows the canonical  probability weighting function that depicts how peo - ple typically weight probabilities when they choose  among different monetary gambles. For example,  people overweight a 5 percent chance of winning  $100 but underweight a 95 percent chance of win - ning that amount. Thus, in essence, people treat both  high and low probabilities as more intermediate than  they really are. This is a regularity that economists  have devoted much attention to, as it helps explain  phenomena such as casino gambling, the overpricing  of positively skewed financial assets, the equity pre - mium and why people prefer insurance policies with  low deductibles.5 The middle panel illustrates a common way in  which people’s inferences from new information tend  to be systematically wrong. When people receive in - formation suggesting that a specified event is objec - tively very unlikely to occur, they often overestimate  such small probabilities. On the other hand, when  people receive information suggesting that an event  is very likely to occur, they underestimate such high  probabilities, which again leads to a compression ef - fect towards the centre.Finally, the right panel shows a typical pattern re - garding people’s expectations of how much the stock  market will go up, as a function of objective probabil - ities. Again, people’s probability estimates are typi - cally heavily compressed towards the centre, which  means that people are overly optimistic as far as very  unlikely scenarios are unconcerned but overly pessi - mistic when it comes to very likely scenarios. The similarity of compression effects in these three  probability domains is striking. Yet, until recently,  economists and psychologists often viewed them as  separate phenomena, rather than as being driven by  a common cognitive mechanism.6 One way of jointly accounting for these patterns  across different domains is the simple insight that  people find it cognitively difficult to think about prob - abilities and, therefore, anchor on an intermediate  cognitive default decision.7 The main idea is that  people mentally start out from an intermediate de - cision, something that is far from the extremes and  feels moderate. Upon deliberation, they then insuffi - ciently adjust in the direction of the rational decision  (the decision that would be expected under a stand - ard rational choice model). Crucially, the idea is that Figure S3.6.1 People have a pronounced tendency to make decisions that look as if they implicitly treat all  probabilities to some degree alike Choice under riskGambling money Belief updatingProcessing information S&P 500 performance expectationsPredicting future events Payoﬀ probabilityImplied probability weight 0.25.5.751 0 .25 .5 .75 1 Risk-neutral expected utility  benchmark Decisions of experimental  participantsBayesian posteriorStated posterior 0.25.5.751 0 .25 .5 .75 1 Rational (Bayesian) beliefs Beliefs of experimental  participantsTrue probabilityStated probability 0.25.5.751 0 .25 .5 .75 1 Historical probability Expectations of survey  participants Source: Enke and Graeber 2019. CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 125 the magnitude of the adjustment towards the ration - al decision decreases in cognitive uncertainty. Thus,  people who are extremely cognitively uncertain will  decide based purely on the cognitive default deci - sion, while people who do not exhibit any cognitive  uncertainty will make a rational decision. According  to this hypothesis, cognitively uncertain decisions are  more compressed towards the centre. Testing of this hypothesis through a series of ex - periments and surveys that measured people’s cog - nitive uncertainty revealed that in all three decision  domains in figure S3.6.1, the gist of the results was  the same: higher cognitive uncertainty is strongly  associated with greater compression of decisions  towards the centre (figure S3.6.2).8 Intuitively, this  makes sense: when people do not know how to value  a risky asset, or if they do not know how to form  probabilistic estimates about variables such as stock  market returns, they anchor on an intermediate de - cision and then only partially adjust away from it. As  a result, cognitively uncertain people overestimate  the probability of unlikely events and overweight  low probabilities when they translate them into risky decisions. Likewise, cognitively uncertain people  underestimate the probability of likely events and  underweight low probabilities when they translate  them into risky decisions. However, these patterns  do not arise because people have acquired do - main-specific errors or even preferences  — instead,  they reflect a general heuristic according to which  people find it difficult to think about probabilities  and, therefore, treat different probabilities to some  degree alike. Intertemporal decisions Consider now an entirely different set of decisions,  in which people trade off money (or other goods) at  different points in time. For example, an experiment  participant may be asked whether she would prefer to  receive $90 today or $100 in a year from now. A large  body of empirical work has documented that people’s  intertemporal decisions are often characterized by a  type of compression effect that is very similar to the  one seen in the case of probabilities.9 Figure S3.6.2 Higher cognitive uncertainty is strongly associated with greater compression of decisions  towards the centre Choice under risk Belief formation Implied probability weight 0255075100 0 20 40 60 80 100 ±1 standard error of median Risk-neutral predictionHigh cognitive uncertainty Low cognitive uncertaintyPayoﬀ probability Bayesian posteriorPosterior belief 0255075100 0 20 40 60 80 100 Note: The left panel illustrates the probability weighting function in choices between monetary lotteries, and the right panel shows reported beliefs  in laboratory belief formation experiments. Source: Enke and Graeber 2019. 126 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 S3.6.3  illustrates this by showing how much peo - ple typically value a payment of $100 to be received  at different points in time. For example, the left panel  shows that, on average, people value $100 in nine  months roughly as much as $60 today and that they  value $100 in four years as much as $40 today. The  main takeaway is that people’s decisions seem to  treat different time delays to some degree alike. For  example, people seem to behave as if it makes almost  no difference to them whether they receive $100 in  two years or in three. Overall, this leads to a compres - sion effect, according to which people’s valuation of  a delayed payment of $100 is again compressed to - wards an intermediate value of roughly $50. Popular models such as the standard discounted  expected utility model, or models of present bias,10  cannot explain these puzzling patterns. For example,  the extreme compression effect towards the centre  also occurs when people make decisions that involve  tradeoffs between two future dates (right panel of fig - ure S3.6.3), such that present bias cannot play a role. One hypothesis is that these patterns do not (only)  reflect present bias or other nonstandard preferences but that they are again driven by complexity and re - sulting cognitive uncertainty.11 The intuition is that  when people are cognitively uncertain about exactly  how much a payment of $100 in three years is worth  to them today, they again anchor on an intermediate  cognitive default decision and then adjust from there   — but insufficiently so. According to this hypothesis,  relative to the benchmark of a rational decisionmak - er, people with cognitive uncertainty will look less pa - tient over short horizons (because the intermediate  cognitive default “drags down” their patience), yet  they will appear more patient over long horizons. Experiments measuring people’s cognitive un - certainty when making these types of intertemporal  decisions show that cognitive uncertainty is strongly  predictive of the degree to which people’s intertem - poral decisions seem to treat all time delays alike  (figure S3.6.4).12 As a result, cognitively uncertain  people exhibit excessively high impatience over short  horizons, such as in tradeoffs between today and in  three months. However, in contrast to conventional  preferences-based accounts of intertemporal choice,  such impatience does not largely reflect genuinely  Figure S3.6.3 People’s decisions about value seem to treat different time delays to some degree alike Intertemporal choice: Delay starting today Intertemporal choice: Delay starting in the future Time delay (years)Normalized indiﬀerence point 0255075100 0 1 4 6 7 Discounted utility benchmark Experimental subjects' discount function2 3 5 Time delay (years)Normalized indiﬀerence point 0255075100 0 1 4 6 7 2 3 5 Note: The left panel shows people’s typical behaviour in tradeoffs between the present and the future, and the right panel shows people’s typical  behaviour in tradeoffs between two different future points in time.

Recap: Commonalities across decision domains The common theme that emerges from the preced - ing discussion is that people’s inability to think  through tricky decision problems is a unifying el - ement that ties together various behaviours. How  people update their beliefs in light of new informa - tion, how they choose between different risky assets  and how they trade off different time-dated rewards  are, in principle, three different domains of econom - ic decisionmaking. Indeed, economists have devised  sophisticated models for each of these domains. Yet,  while there is much benefit in focusing on each deci - sion domain in isolation, doing so also sometimes ob - scures important commonalities across domains. In  particular, we have seen that people are often unsure  what the best decision is, that cognitive uncertainty  is strongly linked to taking “intermediate” decisions that make it seem as if people treat different proba - bilities and time delays alike and that this mechanism  generates many of the famous empirical regularities  that behavioural economists and psychologists have  accumulated over the years. According to the logic of  cognitive uncertainty, these regularities are all inti - mately linked. Potential implications for societal challenges The main takeaway from the studies summarized  above is that when people are cognitively uncertain   — that is, when they find a decision problem difficult  to think through  — they anchor on a cognitive default  and then insufficiently adjust in the direction of the  rational decision. As a result, decisions look as if peo - ple underreact to changes in the prevailing circum - stances such as the probabilities of different events. In experiments the default decision is consistently  intermediate in nature, which could reflect a naïve di - versification or compromise logic. Yet, these choice  experiments all involve contexts with which most  people have limited or no experience. This raises the  question what constitutes people’s cognitive default  decision in situations with which they do have expe - rience, as is usually the case in reality. A plausible conjecture is that when people are cog - nitively uncertain “in the wild,” they intuitively an - chor on their typical past decision and then adjust  from there. For instance, people who always save  $100 of their salary might continue to do so even  when the interest rate suddenly changes  — purely be - cause they find the decision very difficult to think  through and they therefore anchor on their past deci - sion.13 Again, such a pattern of behaviour would pro - duce an underreaction to changes in environmental  conditions. This perspective offers a new lens through which  behaviour in the general public regarding societal  challenges can be understood. For example, thinking  through the consequences of climate change for one’s  own life is cognitively extremely challenging. Even  if we knew for certain that temperatures will rise by  3°C over the next 30 years, it is very hard (even for  experts) to think through how this would affect the  structure of our economies and lifestyles. In other  words it is most likely true that people exhibit very Figure S3.6.4 Cognitive uncertainty is strongly predictive  of the degree to which people’s intertemporal decisions  seem to treat all time delays alike Experimental results: Intertemporal choice Time delay (months)Normalized indiﬀerence point ±1 standard error of median High cognitive uncertaintyLow cognitive uncertainty0255075100 0 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 Note: The dots show how much participants value a cash payment or food  voucher of $100 at different points in time.

Which skills will be valued 30 years  from now? How should I optimally behave in light of  these changes? How and where should I optimally  choose to live given these developments? Even in the absence of any objective uncertainty  about the physical word, these questions are cogni - tively extremely difficult to think through. This cog - nitive difficulty may induce people to anchor on the  cognitive default of making the same decisions as in  the past, which then mechanically produces an un - derreaction to changes in economic and climatic con - ditions. For example, the relatively low investment  into climate change adaptation in the past may serve  as a cognitive anchor for determining today’s invest - ments. If true, this would suggest that the apparent  underreaction in the population to new economic or climatic conditions partly reflects the cognitive dif - ficulty of thinking through complex topics, rather  than necessarily selfish or short-sighted preferences.  This account is potentially valuable because it adds  a new perspective and policy prescription. Rather  than lament about people’s preferences or even try to  change them, policymakers may be more successful at  inducing people to adjust their behaviours by helping  them imagine and think through a future with climate  change: what people’s lives will look like, which types  of jobs they will be competing for, how they will com - mute to work and what their children will learn. Only  when people understand the implications of abstract  policy discussions for which decisions they need to  make to prepare themselves for the future  — once peo - ple have reduced their cognitive uncertainty  — may  they be able to make the decisions that policymakers  and international organizations are hoping for.

Similarly,  formal economic and psychological models of belief formation sometimes  predict that reported beliefs are overly compressed towards 50:50, but  they do not predict that people’s risky decisions are compressed func - tions of beliefs (see Benjamin 2019 for a review).7 Enke and Graeber 2019. The idea that people exhibit noise in process - ing probabilities is present in various theoretical models, including Erev,  Wallsten and Budescu (1994), Khaw, Li and Woodford (2021) and Viscusi  1985, 1989. 8 Enke and Graeber 2019. 9 See, for example, Cohen and others (2020) for a review. 10 Laibson 1997. 11 Enke and Graeber 2021. 12 Enke and Graeber 2021. 13 For example, D’Acunto and others (2021) document that people with  lower cognitive skills react less to changes in interest rates than their  higher-ability counterparts. This may reflect that people entertain a cogni - tive default decision of repeating what they did in the past. CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 129 SPOTLIGHT 3.7 Human agency can help restore biodiversity:  The case of forest transitions Erle C. Ellis,  University of Maryland, Baltimore County Biodiversity losses are increasingly recognized as a  global crisis demanding transformative changes in  human societies to halt further losses and to better  conserve and restore biodiversity.1 Forest habitats  generally sustain more species than other terrestrial  biomes, and moist tropical forests are among the most  biodiverse ecosystems on Earth.2 As a result, the con - version, degradation and fragmentation of forests and  other biodiverse wild habitats by agriculture and other  intensive land uses are currently the leading cause of  biodiversity losses across the terrestrial biosphere.3 For more than a century, human demands for food,  fibre and other land use products have soared to sus - tain the growth of increasingly well-off populations  and their choice of richer diets, including animal  products and other land-demanding commodities.4  To meet these demands, land use for crops and pas - tures have replaced forests and other habitats across  more than 35 percent of Earth’s ice-free land area.5  Yet despite this alarming long-term trend, the glob - al area of agricultural land has not increased signif - icantly since the 1990s, even while the amount of  food produced per capita has risen faster than popu - lation for more than half a century.6 Biodiversity losses remain a serious concern as the  global area used for intensive crops continues to grow,  both within existing agricultural areas and through  deforestation, especially in less developed tropical  regions, where biodiversity losses from land conver - sion are greatest.7 Nevertheless, tropical deforesta - tion appears to be slowing, and forests and other wild  habitats are regenerating in the more developed tem - perate regions of the world where less suitable agri - cultural land is being abandoned.8 Though it remains  unlikely that global forest area in 2030 could increase  by 3 percent relative to 2015 to meet target 1.1 of the  United Nations Strategic Plan for Forests, annual net  loss of forests has been nearly halved since the 1990s,  to about 0.1 percent a year, as a result of declining de - forestation rates and increasing forest regeneration rates.9 Clearly, some forest trends are going in the  right direction, especially in the more developed re - gions of the world. The large-scale regeneration of forests following the  abandonment of agricultural land was first identified  as a general pattern of forest recovery in developed re - gions of Europe starting in the late 1800s.10 In recent  decades these so-called forest transitions, defined  as sustained regional shifts from net deforestation to  net reforestation, are increasingly being observed in  contemporary temperate and tropical regions around  the world.11 The early forest transitions of Europe, the  United States and elsewhere were first explained by  an economic development pathway in which urban - ization and industrialization drove labour scarcity in  agriculture, leading to agricultural intensification to in - crease total production using the most suitable lands,  enabling profits to be maximized and leading to the  abandonment of less productive agricultural lands,  where forests then regenerated spontaneously.12 More recently, “economic” forest transitions have  also been explained, to some degree, through “land  use displacement pathways,” in which forests recover  in one region while potentially being lost in another,  when agricultural demands are outsourced through  globalized supply chains, often to developing regions  of the tropics.13 In land use displacement pathways  the biodiversity benefits of forest regeneration may  be reversed many times over, unless the receiving ag - ricultural region has very high yields (and therefore  lower net land area requirements), owing to the high - er biodiversity of most tropical regions and the poten - tial for land use conversions through deforestation.14  Additional pathways towards forest transitions have  emerged in recent decades, including state and non - governmental organization–supported tree planting  programmes and through land use policies and reg - ulatory pathways supporting forest conservation and  restoration to meet international targets for carbon  and biodiversity.15 130 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 Global supply chain transparency initiatives and  voluntary certification of sustainable production are  helping reduce losses of tropical forests produced  through land use displacement.16 But there is still a  long way to go.17 Even though forest transitions are  increasingly evident around the world, including  in many developing tropical regions,18 at the global  scale, biodiversity losses remain inevitable whenever  land use is simply exported to other regions,19 unless  their productivity is substantially higher or their bio - diversity is substantially lower. The ultimate prospects for a global forest transi - tion to halt losses of biodiversity will depend on the degree to which commodity demands can be met by  increasingly intensive land use practices that shrink  land demand overall  — the classic “economic” path - way of urban and industrial development — combined  with efforts to prioritize the conservation and resto - ration of the most biodiverse regions on Earth.20 The  pace of this development, including urbanization  and agricultural intensification, and the governance  of global commodity supply chains21 will ultimately  determine not only the fate of Earth’s remaining bio - diversity but also the future of human opportunities  with respect to food, housing, employment, recrea - tion and other essential conditions.

CHAPTER 3 — HARNESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT TO NAVIGATE UNCERTAIN TIMES 131  Shaping   our future in a  transforming  worldPART II 134 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022PART II Shaping our future in a transforming world Beyond causing frustration and unsettling minds  (chapter 2), the uncertainties described in chapter  1 can also undermine the ability to act collectively.  Uncertainty has different manifestations. At the in - dividual level it can be seen in the form of human  insecurity. This chapter shows that perceptions of in - security are associated with mistrust and with politi - cal polarization—people who feel insecure trust others  less and are more prone to politically extreme posi - tions. Meanwhile, changes to our information systems are reshaping how people form beliefs and how they  interact with one another. The social changes brought  on by rapidly evolving digital communications tech - nology place additional pressures on human interac - tion. Together, these two shifts are jeopardizing public  deliberation and social choice (chapter 4). But uncer - tainty can also open new possibilities for action, since  it can reframe what is perceived as possible and need - ed: this is explored in chapter 5, on the way to chapter  6, which provides suggestions on the way forward. PART II — SHAPING OUR FUTURE IN A TRANSFORMING WORLD 135  PART II — SHAPING OUR FUTURE IN A TRANSFORMING WORLDWhat’s standing  in the way of our  acting together?CHAPTER 4 138 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022The paradox of our time is paralysis: we know what  the problems are, we have more tools than ever to  address them, but we are failing to act. Why? What is getting in the way? This chapter points to polarization and how  uncertainty and insecurity can exacerbate it. Trust is  down; political extremism is up. Hyperinformation is  sowing division. Spaces for public deliberation are  shrinking right when they are needed most.CHAPTER 4 What’s standing in the way of our acting together? The unprecedented multilayered uncertainties   — coming from the Anthropocene context, social  and technological transformations and political  polarization  — test our social, economic and political  institutions, as well as the patterns of behaviour that  shape and are shaped by those institutions. The link  between the two, as chapter 3 discusses, is the result  of procedures of social choice, reflected in how socie - ties craft collective responses. Why has it proven so difficult to craft these collec - tive responses, which demand changes in both behav - iour and institutions, despite clear evidence of harm  to come for people, societies and the planet? Chapter  3 argues that current configurations of behaviour and  institutions are not responding effectively to a novel  context of uncertainty. This mismatch increases the  importance of processes of public deliberation and  social choice in shaping the behavioural and insti - tutional changes needed in an uncertain world. Pro - cesses of social choice that harness people’s diverse  goals, motivations, beliefs and emotions can be a  powerful driver of social change. However, in many countries today, processes of  public deliberation and social choice are coming  under strain amid intensifying political polarization  and divisiveness.1 Political polarization can be under - stood as “the extent to which citizens become ideo - logically entrenched in their own values and political  beliefs, thereby increasing the divide with citizens  who hold different values and political beliefs.”2 Po- larization tends to make people close in on their in- groups and be reluctant to interact, exchange and  communicate with out-groups. Affective polarization   — the tendency to view out-group members negative - ly and in-group members positively3 — antagonizes  people across partisan lines.4 This animosity is added  to the other forms of issue-based and ideological po - larization between groups that have long been stud - ied in sociology and political science.5 This chapter explores how polarization can inten - sify because of two intertwined developments. First,  the unsettling of people’s lives and experiences of  human insecurity. Second, the massive economic,  social and political shift driven by a rapidly chang - ing (digital) information context. It discusses how  political polarization might diminish the space for  imaginative, effective and just actions needed today,  before suggesting how we might break the hold of uncertainty on collective responses, taking us from a  confused reacting mode to a purposeful harnessing  of uncertainty towards a hopeful future. Uncertain times, divided societies The layers of uncertainty discussed in chapter 1 are  interacting to produce new shocks and dislocations.  But uncertainty is not only about shocks and disloca - tions; it is also about growing gaps in our collective  ability to “make sense” of the world when deciding  our actions. Progress in recent decades has been re - markable in many aspects of human development,  particularly in wellbeing achievements, despite  marked (and in some cases increasing) inequalities  (see chapter 1).6 But despite widespread progress in  wellbeing achievements, around half the population  does not see progress in their living standards relative  to those of their parents. About 40  percent of those  who have more education than their parents do not  perceive intergenerational progress, vividly showing  how expectations of higher future living standards  are being dashed.7 Uncertainty and human insecurity  parallel increases in polarization When uncertainty translates into unsettled lives and  human insecurity, it can increase polarization, im - pacting processes of social choice. Building on the  analysis in chapter 3, the following discussion high - lights the importance of considering beliefs, motiva - tions and emotions as factors accounting for why it  seems hard for people to act individually and collec - tively in the face of uncertainty. Together, these fac - tors shape the issues people find important, people’s  attitudes and behaviours towards others, and the ac - tions people support or undertake themselves.8 “ When uncertainty translates into  unsettled lives and human insecurity,  it can increase polarization, impacting  the processes of social choice What is the connection between uncertain times  and a range of beliefs that matter for public deliber - ation? Here we use the World Values Survey, whose  CHAPTER 4 — WHAT’S STANDING IN THE WAY OF OUR ACTING TOGETHER? 139 representative sample covers around 80  percent of  the global population, to check how people’s percep - tions of insecurity appear connected with beliefs that  worsen polarization. Perceived human insecurity is  a partial measure of individual uncertainty that mir - rors how people’s fundamental freedoms (from want,  fear and indignity) are being affected today (box 4.1).  We first show how perceived human insecurity is  connected with people’s feelings of agency and con - trol over their lives and with their trust in others. The  evidence here suggests that greater human insecuri - ty is linked to lower individual agency and trust. We  then explore associations between perceived human  insecurity and people’s political preferences, show - ing that greater human insecurity is linked to people  holding extreme political preferences. The combina - tion of high insecurity, lower interpersonal trust and  high polarization is more prevalent in low Human  Development Index (HDI) countries and among  lower-  income people. Greater human insecurity is linked with  lower individual agency and trust Human insecurity can directly restrict human agen - cy. High human insecurity reduces people’s ability  to make autonomous decisions because of lack of  resources, because of fear or because of social dis - crimination. These effects often extend to the overall  perception of agency to make choices over their own  lives: people with greater human insecurity tend to  perceive lower agency (figure 4.1).9 Trust in one another influences prospects for co - operation in a group. People tend to trust people clos - er to them (such as family) more than people whom  they do not know or who have a different social back - ground (as with different nationalities or religions).  Lower trust in socially “distant” people influences  social discrimination,10 among other socioeconomic  outcomes.11 This pattern tends to be stronger across  individuals with low incomes and with greater human  insecurity (figure 4.2).12 In other words people with  high incomes and high human security have greater  trust in people from more socially distant groups. Addressing the common challenges that we con - front today requires cooperation in contexts beyond  those where intragroup cooperation tends to be  high  — in particular, addressing planetary challenges implies collaboration not only between governments  but also across other institutions (chapter 6). Inter - personal trust (the most general trust, in essential - ly any human being) has been declining over time.  Globally, fewer than 30 percent of people think that  “most people can be trusted,” the lowest recorded  value. There is a close association between interper - sonal trust and human security.13 Greater human insecurity is linked  to political extremism Greater human insecurity is also linked to political  extremism, understood as attitudes and behaviours  representing polar views or the single-minded pursuit  of one goal over others.14 We capture the first aspect  using preferences along the left-right political spec - trum. People experiencing greater human insecu - rity tend to have a stronger preference for the polar  extremes of the political spectrum: the proportion of Box 4.1 The Index of Perceived Human Insecurity To track human insecurity, we use the Index of Perceived  Human Insecurity. It is based on wave 6 (2010–2014)  and wave 7 (2015–2022) of the World Values Survey1  and reflects mainly a pre-Covid-19 context. The index  is computed for 77 countries and territories, covering  around 80 percent of the global population. It combines  17 variables covering violent conflict and socioeconomic,  personal and community-level insecurity. These insecuri - ties reflect challenges to freedom from want, freedom  from fear and freedom from indignity. • For insecurity from violent conflict, the index uses  variables reflecting worries about a war involving the  country of residence, a civil war or a terrorist attack. • For socioeconomic insecurity the index uses variables  representing explicit worries (losing a job, not being  able to give children education) and actual depriva - tions in health, food and economic security. • For insecurity at the personal and community levels,  the index uses variables of exposure to crime, change  in habits because of security concerns, overall safety  perception of the neighbourhood and assessment of  specific risks (including robbery, alcohol and drugs on  the streets, abuse by law enforcement and racism).

Research on polarization points to several factors that  might cause people to harden their beliefs about their Figure 4.1 Greater insecurity is associated with lower personal agency Human insecurity levelHuman Development Index group 414756514954495355 0 20 40 60 Share of population reporting high control over their lives (%)Very highHighLow Moderate or high Very highLow and medium Source: Human Development Report Office based on World Values Survey, waves 6 and 7.

Here, we consider ev - idence on some of the factors known to contribute to  polarization: • Behavioural drivers affected by a context of un - certainty can intensify people’s identification with  their own social groups. Adding to this is that peo - ple in one group are also generally prone to forming  incorrect beliefs about people in other groups, with  implications for prospects of cooperation across  groups. • Institutional drivers, particularly those associated  with inequalities and disruptive changes in our in - formation systems. The empirical evidence presented above suggests  that individual uncertainty (proxied by perceived  human insecurity) is associated with a particular set of beliefs: diminished agency, lack of trust in others  and more extreme political beliefs. The next section  expands this discussion to additional behavioural fac - tors that can contribute to polarization, as well as in - stitutional conditions that drive polarization. Behavioural factors There is some evidence of a causal link between mul - tiple manifestations of uncertainty and political po - larization.18 It comes from different disciplines, with  several noting the need for humans to reduce or “re - solve” uncertainty.19 For instance, the “need for clo - sure” or the “desire for a definite answer on some  topic, any answer as opposed to confusion and am - biguity…”20 appears as a key motivation for human  behaviour.Figure 4.3 Greater insecurity is linked to political extremism Share of population (%) Extreme  leftExtreme  right Leaning leftMiddle ground Leaning right30 20 10 0Human insecurity level Low Medium or high Very high Political self-identiﬁcation Source: Human Development Report Office based on World Values Survey, waves 6 and 7. See Haerpfer and others (2022). 142 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 According to the significance quest theory, people  need social worth and significance.21 This need is ac - tivated by deprivation (rooted in failure, humiliation  or rejection) or incentivization (the opportunity to  boost one’s significance), which are linked to mani - festations of human insecurity and uncertainty in  general. When activated, the quest for significance  enhances ideological narratives that support the  values of people’s group or culture that give mean - ing to their lives. As a result, people can be attract - ed to affiliating with social identities that become  an “antidote” to uncertainty, social identities that  are in part affirmed as being different — at the limit,  completely opposite  — from others, which can lead to  polarization.22 Another form of adjustment could be through  group identification, as in the uncertainty identity  theory: feelings of uncertainty (particularly related  to self) motivate people to identify with, switch to or  reform social groups in order to cope with those feel - ings.23 Self-uncertainty strengthens group identifica - tion, favouring groups with greater distinctiveness and clear leadership. Through this process self-un - certainty facilitates radicalization (self-identification  with more extreme groups and well-delimited iden - tities), potentially culminating in the support of more  authoritarian leaders.24 More generally, experimental  analysis of brain activity through magnetic resonance  imaging indicates that people with greater intoler - ance of uncertainty are more likely to show more  neural synchrony with politically like-minded peers  and less with opponents, fuelling the formation of po - larized beliefs.25 These mechanisms can be exploited by political  entities and leaders, targeting individuals struggling  with high personal uncertainty through compelling  narratives that are embraced even if they include the  justification of extreme behaviours, such as politi - cal violence.26 Attractive extreme political ideologies  often connect to people’s distress, cognitive simplici - ty (such as a black-and-white perception of the social  world), overconfidence in judgment and intolerance  towards alternative views because of perceived moral  superiority.27 Elites are often politically incentivized Figure 4.4 Insecurity is associated with polarization on preferences over government versus individual responsibility 50 40 30 20 10 0Share of population (%) Extreme  individual reponsibilityExtreme  government reponsibility Leaning individualMiddle ground Leaning governmentHuman insecurity level Low Medium or high Very high Preference for individual versus government responsibility Source: Human Development Report Office based on World Values Survey, waves 6 and 7.

CHAPTER 4 — WHAT’S STANDING IN THE WAY OF OUR ACTING TOGETHER? 143 to fuel polarization, with direct negative campaigns,  uncivil discourse and vitriol against political oppo - nents28 or to leverage divisions over contentious so - cial issues, such as immigration and race in some  settings.29 Elite polarization has been found to result  in greater affective polarization in the electorate  —  when elite positions are polarized, people express  more negative sentiment towards opposing par - ties30 and become more tolerant of undemocratic  behaviour.31 “ The confluence of heightened uncertainty with  high inequality often seems to favour support  for authoritarian leaders, who are less likely to  foster intragroup and intergroup cooperation The style of leadership supported in uncertain  times may also favour support for authoritarian lead - ers. Anthropology and social psychology have iden - tified two routes through which leaders emerge.32  One is by acquiring prestige, respect and admiration  and being recognized as possessing superior skills,  achievements or knowledge. The other is by becom - ing dominant, assertive, controlling, decisive and  confident, often coercing or inducing fear. In contexts  of economic uncertainty dominant leaders often ap - pear to have greater appeal than prestige leaders.33  And higher economic inequality also attracts and  often favours support for dominance-oriented lead - ers, with inequality also providing incentives for lead - ers to pursue their own self-interest over the interests  of the groups they lead.34 The confluence of height - ened uncertainty with high inequality thus often  seems to favour support for authoritarian leaders,  who are less likely to foster intragroup and intergroup  cooperation. Polarization has to do with a group forming nega - tive beliefs about other out-groups, and people are  generally prone to forming such beliefs in an incor - rect way. A substantial body of evidence shows that  people’s perceptions about others are generally bi - ased.35 People can misjudge what other individuals  in society think, feel and do.36 Not only is mispercep - tion of others widespread, it also tends to be asym - metric: far more people hold beliefs about others that  fall on one side of the truth over the other.37 In par - ticular, people harbour greater misperceptions when  considering those outside their own social groups than those closer to them. Inaccurate perceptions  about out-groups are widespread, with evidence to  this effect over localized points of disagreement in 26  countries.38 Indeed, people’s perception that others hold more  extreme positions than they actually do itself contrib - utes to polarization. People’s perception that those  from opposing parties hold extreme positions has  been found to be more strongly associated with an - imus towards out-party members than with actual  differences in policy preferences.39 People who iden - tify with a specific group underestimate the extent  to which they agree with the views of other groups’  opponents.40 People also tend to misperceive how  others view them. These perceptions are uniquely  associated with hostility, aggression and in some set - tings a willingness to violate democratic norms.41 What might explain people’s tendencies to routine - ly misperceive others? One candidate is stereotyping,  where people tend to adopt overgeneralized mental  models of out-group members. Another is motivated  reasoning: people are biased towards interpreting in - formation in ways that affirm their beliefs. So, affec - tive factors could be contributing to misperception  (rather than the other way around  — misperceptions  causing people to have negative attitudes towards  others).42 Institutional factors The rise in polarization today comes alongside  progress in other dimensions of human wellbeing   — greater economic prosperity, uptake of new tech - nologies, and improvements in health, education and  gender equality  — and despite the formal strengthen - ing of socioeconomic institutions (box 4.2). Increas - ing polarization amid greater progress signals that  what is often called “development” may not always  deliver for people as expected. In-group–out-group polarization can be framed  in the context of the potential mismatch discussed  in chapter 3. A rapid transformation with new lay - ers of uncertainty can shake norms and values that  are ill matched to current realities. This triggers ad - vocates of new responses, risking polarization be - tween advocates for change and those rejecting or  alienated by change.43 Intragroup cohesiveness can  increase when people are confronted with threats  but often at the expense of intergroup cooperation.  144 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 For instance, after violent conflict, trust and cooper - ation increase within groups but not between them.44  War also seems to increase religiosity, another form of affiliating with a social group based on shared be - liefs.45 People seek to reduce ambivalence in their per - ception of others by creating clear “us” and “them” Box 4.2 Progress with polarization in the global Positive Peace Index The Positive Peace Index measures the positive peace of 163 countries, covering 99.6 percent of the world popula - tion. Positive peace is defined as the attitudes, institutions and structures that create and sustain peaceful societies.  It is based on more than 45,700 data series, indices and attitudinal survey variables in conjunction with current  thinking about the drivers of violent conflict, resilience and peacefulness. The index covers eight pillars, using three  indicators for each. The pillars are: • Well-functioning government. • Equitable distribution of resources. • Free flow of information. • Good relations with neighbours. • High human capital. • Acceptance of the rights of others. • Low corruption. • Sound business environment. The 24 indicators fall into three domains: • Attitudes, which measure social views, tensions  or perceptions. • Institutions, which are associated with the func - tioning of the formal and informal organizations  that manage and influence the socioeconomic  system. • Structures, which are embedded in the frame - work of society, such as poverty and equality, or  are the result of aggregate activity, such as GDP. The six indicators in the attitudes domain are  factionalized elites, group grievance, quality of in - formation, exclusion by socioeconomic condition,  hostility to foreigners and freedom of the press.  These indicators were used as proxies for social  attitudes — that is, the way individuals and groups  perceive and interact within their society. • Deteriorations in attitudes are changes in social perceptions and patterns of interactions among individuals and  groups that lead to more social disharmony, more violence or fear thereof, deeper political instability or more  disruptive economic inefficiencies. • Improvements in attitudes are changes in social perceptions and patterns of interaction among individuals and  groups that lead to enhanced social cohesion, less violence, more political cooperation, greater institutional trans - parency and economic efficiencies. Using this classification framework, the data suggest a steep divergence in development patterns over the past 10  years (box figure 1). The global average of the structures domain suggests uninterrupted progress, as gauges of ag - gregate economic performance, scientific and technological development, and business indicators have continually  improved since 2009. By contrast, the global averages of the attitudes domain have deteriorated markedly — a proxy  for polarization. The institutions domain has also deteriorated, though modestly. This is the paradox of economic and business progress with increasing social polarization. Despite improvements  in aggregate economic performance, technological advancement and business opportunities, societies appear to  have become less harmonious, and political preferences appear to have become more factionalized and intolerant.

CHAPTER 4 — WHAT’S STANDING IN THE WAY OF OUR ACTING TOGETHER? 145 boundaries.46 The tightening47 of social norms and  their heightened enforcement or sanctioning are  also a collective response to cope with threats and  uncertainty48 — perhaps an evolved cultural adaption  to deal collectively with uncertainty.49 But mismatch - es can occur when some societies overtighten norms  in the face of perceived tangible threats and loosen  them in the face of real threats.50 Economic hardship and income inequality might  parallel trends in polarization.51 Beliefs and behav - iours prioritizing in-group affiliation can emerge as  coping mechanisms in times of economic volatility  and rising inequality, possibly leading to group po - larization.52 This acquires different manifestations  in different geographic contexts, but large num - bers of people around the world are already feeling  the dislocations associated with the implications of  trade, technology or both. In nearly all high-income  and upper middle-income countries, wage income  to workers is shrinking as a share of GDP.53 Pros - pects will improve for some people  —  those with the  enhanced capabilities to seize on the opportunities  of the 21st century.54 But other groups will feel less  secure  — those seeing their livelihoods or social status  threatened. In times of hardship or in places where  dislocations cause economic hardship, polarization  intensifies, and support can increase for leaders who  reject pluralism, including those hostile to foreigners  and migrants.55 Inequalities, and perceptions of inequality,56 may  undermine the basic promise of fundamental po - litical equality.57 It is argued that we are witness - ing the secession from political life58 of those at the  very top, isolated and disconnected through their  privilege, and those at the very bottom, disaffect - ed and disenfranchised in their agency and voice.  These inequalities  — especially income and wealth  inequality  — have an impact on political engagement,59  which often translates into low political participa - tion among the most disadvantaged.60 Institutions  have sometimes struggled to safeguard the integrity  of the rituals of choice whereby societies can collec - tively and iteratively design their fate and determine  the winning and losing political positions without un - dermining formal systems and without disagreement  turning into disrespect of others and of institutions.61  In recent decades inequalities have been accom - panied by rising nationalism and identity-based politics in many countries. There is substantial vari - ation across countries in how class-based inequalities  interact with other social divides, leading to diverse  patterns in political cleavages; how political institu - tions manage these cleavages also influences dynam - ics between groups (spotlight 4.1). “ Inequalities, and perceptions of inequality,  may undermine the basic promise of  fundamental political equality Widening inequalities and worsening prospects  for many workers around the world are connected to  the global rise of market power of some firms: as the  winner-takes-all structure of new technologies paired  with challenged antitrust policies allows some com - panies to thrive with high profits, while lower shares  of income accrue to workers.62 The rise in market  power can lead to monopolistic competition, raising  company profits while keeping worker wages low.63  Firms that were able to innovate in new information  platforms are now giants of technology. These “su - perstar” firms, with a high capacity to innovate and  very high profits, have seen rising market power.  Their markups (the difference between sales prices  and production costs) are high, contributing to the  decline in the labour’s share of income.64 Hyper-information is powering social  division and polarization As chapter 3 argues, we may be confronting a mis - match between behaviour and the institutions that  exist now and those required to navigate through a  new context of multilayered uncertainties.65 In addi - tion, the world faces another mismatch between the  availability of information (about people’s actions,  interactions and perceptions, captured through mul - tiple platforms and social media) and our ability to  effectively harness it in processes of social choice.66  Changes to how we produce and share information  are part of a broader social and cultural change. The  ubiquity of information and communications tech - nology today signifies a substantially different world  from just a few decades ago. Technological advanc - es are dramatically altering how people form their  beliefs and values and how these are transmitted  146 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 through social connections and networks. People in - teracting with one another on digital networks are en - gaging in new cultural practices.67 New social groups  and networks can emerge online that are widely dis - tributed and decentralized, involving only loosely  connected individuals. As this section discusses, the  social changes generated by the rapidly evolving (dig - ital) information ecosystem are introducing new vul - nerabilities to processes of public deliberation, even  as they support collective action in other ways. Advances in digital technology are  disrupting social networks In many respects digital social media can support  processes of public deliberation. The free flow of in - formation is fundamental to democratic process - es. Accurate information allows people to develop  well-informed policy preferences, hold those in  power accountable and participate meaningfully in  democratic debate. Information is an important part  of any strategy to address the complex challenges be - fore us. For instance, information about the extent  and scale of climate change is important for spurring  actions to minimize human-induced pressures on the  planet. And technologies for sharing information,  such as social media, play an important role in sup - porting collective action. Digital social media pro - vide new ways for groups to interact, find common  ground and even organize into movements. There  are several such examples of digital media supporting  collective action, from protesting racial or ethnic vio - lence to advocating for workers’ rights and the rights  of gender-diverse groups and indigenous peoples.  Communications technology promises a means for  marginalized, minoritized or threatened groups to or - ganize and effect change. However, recent advances in digital communi - cations technology have also been disruptive to our  social networks, more so than communications ad - vances in the past (box 4.3). There are at least four  key changes in our social systems as a result of rapid  advances in information and communications tech - nology.68 They have dramatically altered the stability  and functionality of social networks. • Changes in scale. Social networks have expanded  massively in scale, to nearly 7 .8 billion people.69  The sheer number of people involved complicates decisionmaking, cooperation and coordination.70  Mechanisms for cooperation or coordination may  be scale-dependent, and new institutions may be  required to meet these functions as social networks  grow so large.71 Changes in scale can undermine  cooperation and impede consensus.72 “ Digital social media provide new ways  for groups to interact, find common ground  and even organize into movements, but  recent advances in digital communications  technology have also been disruptive  to our social networks, more so than  communications advances in the past • Changes in structure. The structure of human social  networks has changed. A large population com - bined with technology that connects otherwise  disparate groups allows for network structures  that were not previously possible. Where humans  had social connections with at most a few hundred  others in the past, online media platforms now  connect much larger networks of people to one  another, as do traditional media sources. Positive  aspects of these networks include the greater  possibility of collaboration across borders, the  diffusion of scientific ideas and expansion of the  networks of those who may otherwise be isolated.  However, some features of these networks, such as  long ties and inequality of influence, can facilitate  harm.73 For instance, these networks can foster  echo chambers and spread misleading or inaccu - rate information. • Information fidelity. New communications tech - nology allows for information to be transmitted  without decay or noise across several degrees  of separation.74 This makes it easy for false and  misleading information to spread fast and widely.  Rapid information flows may overwhelm cogni - tive processes and lead to less accurate decisions.75  Because information is cheaper to produce and dis - tribute, low quality information can spread more  easily. • Algorithmic decisionmaking. Algorithms are widely  used to filter, curate and display information on - line. When designed to share information based on  user preferences and usage patterns, they work as  feedback loops and drive new content exposures  CHAPTER 4 — WHAT’S STANDING IN THE WAY OF OUR ACTING TOGETHER? 147 that become more extreme over time.76 Given  people’s tendency to seek friendly social environ - ments, algorithmic feedback may narrow the infor - mation and networks that users are exposed to: so  they can induce biases in perceived reality and con - tribute to polarization.77 The algorithms that online  media platforms use are typically proprietary, and  there is limited transparency in how algorithmic  decisions for information flows might be altering  human collective behaviour.78 Disruptive changes in information systems  can compromise public deliberation The changes described above are altering processes  of public deliberation. More information and larger networks are not unequivocally empowering. Along - side benign or socially beneficial information flows,  unreliable and unverified information can also be  transmitted with ease through today’s social net - works. One area of concern is the proliferation of mis - information.79 Online spaces have become hotbeds  of politically motivated misinformation, with nega - tive effects on social dynamics and processes, such  as elections80 and treatment of minorities.81 While  misinformation itself is not a new phenomenon, on - line media have increased the reach, influence and  impact of inaccurate information.82 Misinformation  can emerge from a range of actors, including govern - ments, groups and bots designed to convince people  that they are authentic users.83 The spread of false  information can be especially harmful in times of Box 4.3 Advances in digital communications risk destabilizing societies Our species has enjoyed a comparatively stable existence for more than 100,000 years. Humans lived and spread in  loosely connected hunter-gatherer groups numbering in the tens or low hundreds. Our biology at that time was not  fundamentally different from what it is today, exhibiting rich cultural features such as tool use, social bonds, language,  intergroup conflict, art and knowledge sharing. The stability of our species, by almost any measure, changed dramatically with the first agricultural revolution  12,000 years ago. Growing crops and raising animals led many hunter-gather groups to abandon a mobile lifestyle to  form settlements. Organized labour distribution allowed larger groups to coexist in a given geographic area. Convert - ing land for agricultural use provided nutrition to support rapid population growth. Further technological advances  fundamentally altered how most humans interact. Writing, for instance, opened the potential for ledgers, economies,  codified laws and sequestering of wealth. The printing press enabled large-scale distribution of information by those  able to afford the upfront production costs. The Industrial Revolution enabled us to extract and convert natural resources at a dramatically faster pace. Pho - tography, radio, telephony, powered transit and television fostered communication across vast spaces at high speed.  These advances caused subsequent generations to bear less and less similarity to previous ones. Although technol - ogy has brought us many things, stability is not among them. Discussions of digital communications technology, from social media and search engines to artificial intelligence  and cryptocurrency, often occur against this backdrop. Scholars, technologists, politicians and lay people often argue  that the internet is simply our generation’s printing press. Harms are seen as mere growing pains and a far cry from  existential. Our continuing existence is held up as evidence of a collective behavioural invisible hand that will guide  us forward much as it brought us here. However, there are reasons to believe that digital communication technologies today are both quantitatively and  qualitatively distinct from past advances. Engineering decisions that reshape our society can now be deployed in - stantaneously and without oversight to billions of users, dramatically outpacing historical adoption timelines and  creating novel challenges for evidence-based regulation. Further differentiating current advances from past ones,  modern communication technology leverages vast datasets and complex algorithms to couple social systems to  technological ones. Most important, past technological advances have not produced stable social dynamics, particularly in our interac - tions with the natural world. Digital communications technology, while nascent, has more potential than any past  advance to alter social dynamics. Given the precarious state of our natural world and global inequalities, disruptions  that bring about further instability are existential threats for many.

In many parts of the world, waves of un - reliable information preceded increases in Covid-19  infections.84 “ Social media might lead people to perceive  political divisions to be more extreme,  to become more affectively polarized  and enclosed in their own views and to  have hostile or negative discourse about  others be rewarded or reinforced through  increased engagement in social media Human cognition can facilitate the spread and  influence of misinformation. In contrast to mod - els of rational choice, people routinely rely on men - tal shortcuts to bypass some of the information they  encounter when making decisions (see chapter 3).85  Heuristics allow people to reduce the complexity of  these judgments to a more manageable scale. It is in  conjunction with people’s cognitive and behavioural  tendencies that today’s advanced communications  technologies can strain how societies process infor - mation and form beliefs. For instance, that fake posts  spread wider and faster than truthful news online has  been attributed to humans being more likely to spread  fake information rather than to those outcomes being  an artefact of algorithmic choices.86 People tend to  turn towards information that reinforces their exist - ing beliefs  — a manifestation of confirmation bias.  “Repulsion” away from opposing viewpoints is also a  powerful motivator.87 Algorithmic decisionmaking and feedback in on - line spaces can influence the flow of information in  unpredictable, and often opaque, ways. Some design  characteristics of online media platforms can facili - tate polarization. Recommendation algorithms can  shape how information spreads on social networks,  encouraging people to vote against their interests.88  Research from Twitter’s Machine Learning, Ethics,  Transparency and Accountability Team indicated  that their content recommendation algorithms ap - pear to amplify right-leaning politicians across the  majority of countries surveyed.89 Although they could  not identify why the algorithm exhibited this behav - iour, it is conceivable that such unexpected algorith - mic behaviour could affect democratic outcomes in  ways that external observers cannot evaluate.Interactions on social media can increase per - ceptions of difference.90 Selective exposure to like-   minded attitudinal content increases polarization  by reinforcing existing attitudes.91 There is evidence  of political sorting on social networks: people adjust  their online social ties to avoid encountering news  from nonpreferred sources, leading to homogenized  online networks.92 Moreover, negative discourse  about the out-group can get positive reinforcements  through increased engagement on social media in  comparison to language about the in-group.93 Put plainly, social media might lead people to per - ceive political divisions to be more extreme, to be - come more affectively polarized and enclosed in their  own views and to have hostile or negative discourse  about others be rewarded or reinforced through in - creased engagement in social media. Although social  media are certainly not responsible for all polariza - tion, they have provided a space for new tactics and  paths towards misinformation and polarization.94 Polarization harms public  deliberation in uncertain times As the analysis here shows, uncertainty creates fer - tile ground for political polarization, with worry - ing consequences for public deliberation, precisely  when societies must come together to tackle emerg - ing threats. Polarization is much more than simple  differences in preferences or beliefs. After all, differ - ences between groups of people need not impede our  ability to work together and generate sound policy.  Some differences between people are often benefi - cial.95 And holding many different interests, identities  and social connections can constrain social fragmen - tation. Even where people disagree on ideological  grounds or policy issues, they are less likely to expe - rience political isolation by virtue of their rich social  interactions and overlapping identities.96 When peo - ple share beliefs across groups, the space for healthy  interaction and deliberation increases. Rather than a matter of differing preferences or be - liefs, the polarization documented in many societies  today is more pernicious: “the normal multiplicity of  differences in the society increasingly align along a  single dimension, cross-cutting differences become  reinforcing, and people increasingly perceive and  describe politics and society in terms of ‘us’ versus  CHAPTER 4 — WHAT’S STANDING IN THE WAY OF OUR ACTING TOGETHER? 149 ‘them.’”97 In other words polarization has to do with  deepening social divisions between groups, where in - tergroup relationships become hostile and disharmo - nious, distrust between groups intensifies, opposing  groups tend towards more extreme positions and the  scope for cooperation diminishes. In many settings polarization is spilling over into  spaces that would otherwise have been ones of coex - istence, such as families and neighbourhoods.98 When  social networks become segregated, groups have limit - ed information about others’ preferences, diminishing  impulses towards cooperation and coordination. Rath - er than any differences over values, it is the breakdown  in communication between groups that impedes pub - lic deliberation.99 Coming to consensus on issues takes  longer when opposing groups are homogenized, and  deliberation within homogeneous groups tends to lead  people to adopt more extreme positions that they oth - erwise would on their own.100 Polarization contributes  to discontent with democratic systems. In a polarized  society one group (“us”) may see the actions of other  opposing groups (“them”) as impeding its efforts to  shape policy within democratic systems. “ Severe polarization can make  people blind to the fact that there are  strategies where all sides can gain Frustration with democratic processes can be the  result, especially where impulses for collaboration  have already been weakened by processes of group  homogenization.101 Democratic institutions them - selves can struggle to accommodate the priorities of  deeply polarized groups, resulting in deadlocks and  public disaffection.102 In-group–out-group polariza - tion can become a driving factor in supporting author - itarian leaders,103 thus putting democratic processes  under strain.104 Accounting for the rise of radical and  populist parties, scholars have shown that declining  trust in institutions is associated with diminishing  support for traditional insider parties.105 People’s tol - erance for undemocratic actions increases, creating  conditions for democratic decline or even reversal.  There is evidence of the erosion of attitudes towards  democracy and peaceful deliberation in high HDI  countries associated with human insecurity (spot - light 4.2).106 In national politics polarization advan - tages leaders that shun negotiation and compromise and does lasting damage to the norms that underpin  democracy, such as tolerance for differing views.107 The rise in political polarization is occurring in the  context of a long-term, global disaffection with dem - ocratic practices.108 The Varieties of Democracy ap - proach makes an effort to capture this process and  argues that there has been a deterioration of critical  ingredients of democracy (figure 4.5). Freedom of  expression is declining in around 35 countries, more  than three times the number where it is increasing.  Similarly, deliberation is in decline in more than four  times the number of countries where it is improving.  Clean elections, rule of law and freedom of associa - tion are also in decline in more countries than where  they are improving. Severe polarization can make people blind to the  fact that there are strategies where all sides can  gain. Instead, they may end up behaving as though  life is a zero-sum game. This dynamic can be self- reinforcing: “the less they [ people ] undertake joint  collective actions, the more their perceptions of dif - ference, and the more likely it is that they will per - ceive their interests to be zero-sum.”109 Dynamics of  polarization affect not just how people feel about oth - ers who think differently but also how people act. For  example, in the United States social distancing be - haviours, using masks, getting vaccinated and beliefs  about risk during the Covid-19 pandemic correlate  with partisan divisions.110 Polarization also makes in - ternational cooperation harder. For example, party  polarization has negative consequences for national  commitments to international environmental agree - ments.111 We risk losing some of the benefits of liv - ing in plural societies  — a diversity of knowledge and  ideas as well as decisionmaking that is responsive to  as many people and groups as possible.112 Worryingly, polarization is difficult to reverse when it  involves a positive feedback mechanism. When positive  feedback increases (such as political parties adopting  more extreme positions), polarization can ascend to a  tipping point, after which it becomes a self-reinforcing,  runaway process.113 And once it has set in, polarization  is hard to reverse, even in the face of external shocks.114 The discussion in this chapter explains how polari - zation may emerge and persist in a context of uncer - tainty and how the appeal of authoritarian leaders  may increase. But these are not mechanistic and pre - determined outcomes. Greater uncertainty does not  150 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 have to lead to polarization. There are multiple exam - ples in history where uncertainty was faced through  broad collaboration. With uncertainty people can  turn to values that go beyond strategic thinking about  seeking the pursuit of self-interest alone. If there is  trust, that value can be solidarity. Experimental evidence indicates that uncertainty  can affect the morality of individuals. Participants in  experiments appeared less likely to lie and more like - ly to share resources under uncertainty, reducing the  scope for purely strategic self-interested behaviour.115  More important, the power of reasoning and public  deliberation is not diminished in uncertain times,  particularly when the broad notion of capabilities,  emphasizing agency and freedoms, is considered. Breaking the hold of uncertainty  on collective action Political polarization associated with human insecu - rity, and the inadequacy of our institutions in times of change is standing in the way of more decisive joint  action to face common challenges. Despite clear pro - gress on many fronts, human insecurity is putting  people under stress and pulling people apart. Human  insecurity is associated with lower interpersonal trust  and tendencies towards political extremism. Meanwhile, rapid changes in information systems  are a source of added instability in our social sys - tems. Many of the challenges of sustaining informa - tion systems that support democratic deliberation  are not new. After all, the spread of misleading infor - mation, censorship and other impediments to demo - cratic debate existed long before the advent of digital  communications technologies. The difference today  is that our information systems now operate at such  a broad scale that they pose a systemic challenge to  public deliberation, just when our ability to act to - gether to deal with large-scale societal challenges is  so critical. Development progress  — with achievements in dif - ferent dimensions of human development — has gone Figure 4.5 Ten years ago there were more countries where critical elements for democratic governance were  improving than declining — today, the situation is reversed Clean elections Elected oﬃcials Freedom of expression Freedom of association Deliberation Rule of law Judicial constraints Legislative constraints Suﬀrage 05101520253035 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35Number of countries improving2000–2 011 Clean elections Elected oﬃcialsFreedom of expression Freedom ofassociationDeliberation Rule of lawJudicial constraints Legislative constraints  Suﬀrage 05101520253035 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Number of countries declining Number of countries declining2011–2 021 Number of countries improving Deliberative component            Electoral democracy             Liberal component Note: Figure shows the number of countries improving and declining significantly and substantially for different components of democracy.

CHAPTER 4 — WHAT’S STANDING IN THE WAY OF OUR ACTING TOGETHER? 151 along with institutions that have structured human  interactions116 and made that very progress possible.  But as chapter 3 argues, we may be reaching a point  of mismatch between the institutions and social  configurations that have enabled progress up to now  and those required to face new challenges exempli - fied by the uncertainty complex.117 The two process - es contributing to polarization today may reflect this  mismatch  — of institutions inadequately responding  to people’s unsettledness and insecurity and to a rap - idly changing (digital) information context. How do  we break the vicious cycle of increased polarization,  the reduced space for collaboration, the multilay - ered uncertainties? Advancing human development  (in terms of wellbeing and agency, achievements  and freedoms) remains the foundation for shaping  the behavioural and institutional changes needed to  navigate our uncertain times. Expanding capabilities  provides a way to enhance the diversity of voices in - volved in public deliberation to this end, to the extent  that processes of deliberation allow for the full range  people’s beliefs and motivations to be scrutinized and  reasoned. “ Polarization impedes public deliberation,  thereby working against the cooperation needed  to address novel, multilayered uncertainties Polarization impedes public deliberation, thereby  working against the cooperation needed to address  novel, multilayered uncertainties. Two critical ele - ments are deeply interconnected in breaking the hold  of uncertainty on collective action. First, tackling people’s unsettledness and human  insecurity. Thriving under uncertainty requires  human security, overcoming the mismatch between  aspiration and achievements.118 Our ability to im - plement the many transformations needed today  —  local, national and global  — depends on our ability to  agree on what needs to be done, to generate broad  social support and then to implement creative policy  change amid uncertainty. Addressing the basic driv - ers of unsettledness and insecurity in people’s lives is  essential.Existing strategies for human security need to be  upgraded. An expanded concept of human security  for the Anthropocene combines strategies of protec - tion, empowerment and solidarity (where solidarity  recognizes the interdependence among people and  between people and the planet).119 This agenda de - pends on several actions, and there are some practi - cal examples, such as strengthening social protection  systems with built-in adaptive capabilities. Robust so - cial protection not only allows people to better weath - er shocks but also helps sustain people’s wellbeing  and broad participation in decisionmaking. In other  words effective social protection systems can support  agency. To directly address the spread of polariza - tion, policies that seek to counter the feedback cycle  between inequality and polarization are also crucial.120 Second, steering the expansion of social networks  to advance human development. It is imperative to  acknowledge that the digital world occupies a cen - tral role in our social interactions and to set principles  and norms to guide its expansion, so it favours human  flourishing and an equitable and effective collective  deliberation. A hands-off approach is not enough  —  there is little to suggest that an information ecosys - tem organized for narrow private interests (including  boosting engagement, ad sales or short-term profit)  might organically evolve into a space for free, open  and informed collective deliberation.121 Principles of  stewardship, comparable to managing complex eco - systems, have relevance for strengthening our infor - mation systems.122 Within this framework three steps  can be considered: • Increasing transparency over how companies opt  to sort, filter and display information to users. • Improving access and equity in leveraging informa - tion and communications technology. • Enhancing our understanding more broadly of how  new technologies are shaping public discourse and  deliberation.123 As detailed in the following chapter, new oppor - tunities for transformation are emerging against a  backdrop of rapid technological change and the re - cent Covid-19 crisis. Chapter 6 suggests a way for - ward, with a framework for action in uncertain times. 152 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 In our new book, Political Cleavages and Social Ine - qualities,1 we investigate where and how class divides  emerge and how they interact with other social con - flicts (ethnic, regional, generational, gender and the  like). In what contexts do we see inequality become  politically salient and why? What determines the  strength of identity-based divides, and how do these  conflicts interact with the structure of social inequal - ities? Drawing on a unique set of surveys conducted  between 1948 and 2020 in 50 countries on five conti - nents, our volume sheds new light on these questions  and provides a new data source to investigate voting  behaviours in a global and historical perspective: the  World Political Cleavages and Inequality Database  (http:/ /wpid.world ). Among the many findings of the book, three interest - ing facts emerge from the analysis of this new dataset. The intensity of class divisions varies  widely in contemporary democracies We document a gradual decoupling of two comple - mentary measures of social class in many European  and North American democracies: income and ed - ucation. In the early post–World War II decades the  party systems of these democracies were class-based:  social democratic and affiliated parties represented  both the low-education and the low-income elec - torates, whereas conservative and affiliated parties  represented both high-education and high-income  voters (figure S4.1.1). These party systems have grad - ually evolved towards what we can call multi-elite  party systems: social democratic and affiliated parties  have become the parties of higher-educated elites,  while conservative and affiliated parties remain the  parties of high-income elites. In contrast to the gradual decoupling between in - come and education that we find in many European and North American democracies, in other regions  there are large variations in the configuration and  intensity of class divides. These variations can often  be explained by the relative importance of other di - mensions of political conflict. The interaction among  class, regional, ethnic, religious, generational, gen - der and other forms of divides thus plays a key role  in determining the ways through which inequalities  are politically represented in democracies around the  world today. Ethnic diversity is not synonymous  with ethnic conflict Another major finding of our global perspective on  political divides is that ethnic and religious conflicts  vary widely across countries and over time. In par - ticular, more diverse countries are not necessarily  those where ethnic or religious conflicts are more  intense. Instead, varieties of political cleavage struc - tures can be accounted for in part by history, such as  the ability of national liberation movements to bring  together voters from different origins. They also have  an important socioeconomic component: in democ - racies where ethnoreligious groups tend to cluster  across regions and differ markedly in their standards  of living, political parties also tend to reflect ethnic af - filiations to a greater extent. Identity politics take different forms The large variations in class and sociocultural divides  in contemporary democracies point to a more general  pattern. Political cleavages can take multiple forms,  depending on the nature of underlying social con - flicts and on the ability of political parties to embody  these conflicts in the democratic arena.SPOTLIGHT 4.1 Inequality and the structure of political conflict in  democracies: A global and historical perspective Amory Gethin  (Paris School of Economics — École des hautes études en sciences sociales  and World Inequality  Lab), Clara Martínez-Toledano  (Imperial College London and World Inequality Lab), Thomas Piketty  (Paris School  of Economics —  École des hautes études en sciences sociales  and World Inequality Lab) 153 CHAPTER 4 — WHAT’S STANDING IN THE WAY OF OUR ACTING TOGETHER? In European and North American democracies, for  instance, the rise of conflicts over immigration and the  environment have come together with the decline of  class divides and of traditional left-wing parties, per - haps because they are perceived as unable to propose  convincing redistributive platforms. It has also coin - cided with a decline in turnout among low-income and lower-educated voters, pointing to a more general dis - satisfaction among these voters with the functioning  of democracy. Nonetheless, the shift to identity poli - tics observed in many democracies today is neither in - evitable nor generalized. In several countries outside  Europe and North America the class-based dimension  of political conflicts has intensified in recent decades.Figure S4.1.1 The emergence of multi-elite party systems in Australia, Europe and North America 1960– 19641965– 19691970– 19741975– 19791980– 19841985– 19891990– 19941995– 19992000– 20042005– 20092010– 20142015– 2020Diﬀeren ce between share of top 10% educated voting left  and share of bottom 90%  educated voting left Diﬀeren ce between share of top 10% earners  voting left  and share of bottom 90%  earners  voting left T op-income voters voting for  right-wing parties (other parties)Higher-educated voters voting  for left-wing parties (democratic,  labour, social democratic,  socialist, green and the like) Note: In the 1960s both higher-educated and high-income voters were less likely to vote for left-wing (democratic, labour, social democratic, socialist,  green) parties than lower-educated and low-income voters by more than 10 percentage points.

Uncertainty can affect this role,  through polarization, which in turn can affect beliefs  about democratic institutions. Overall, support for  democracy is high globally. But the share of people  considering democracy very important is sensitive to  the perceptions of human insecurity, particularly in  very high Human Development Index (HDI) coun - tries and among high-income groups (figure S4.2.1,  left panel). Moreover, people’s justification of violence  as a political tool also appears highly connected with  human insecurity, in particular among high-income segments (figure S4.2.1, right panel).1 Among high- income groups, an insecure person is more than twice  as likely to justify violence or not consider democracy  very important than a secure person. These results in - dicate a potentially destabilizing dynamic of negative  attitudes towards cooperation at the top. This trend  should be of concern, considering that people affected  by high insecurity account for more than 40 percent  of the population in very high HDI countries (even be - fore the Covid-19 pandemic). Why are people in higher HDI countries more sen - sitive to human insecurity (measured by attitudes and  Figure S4.2.1 Support for democracy drops with insecurity in wealthier groups 30.221.212.131.525.721.127.926.922.4 Share of population within group (%)Democracy not very important 26.914.111.420.317.414.118.315.613.9 Share of population within group (%)Political violence justiﬁableAttitudes towards democracy and political violence in very high Human Development Index countries Low Medium HighLow Medium High 0 10 20 30 0 10 20 30Human insecurity levelIncome level Low Moderate or high Very high Note: Values are pooled individual-based data with equal weights across countries.

And because people near the top  of the HDI have known greater human security, they  are likely to feel “entitled” to it and therefore per - ceive insecurity as a loss. This may be a reason why  people in higher HDI countries derive more distress  from human insecurity.3 The feeling of uncertainty across HDI categories  can also be affected by the mismatch between expec - tations and reality: people suffering insecurity in very  high HDI countries and high-income countries are more likely to experience the cognitive dissonance  of development-with-insecurity: income, a meas - ure of worth and success that often guides people’s  behaviour and incentives, cannot in these extreme  cases protect against threats, as could be typically  expected. As market-based mechanisms of security  and regular state-based policies struggle to deliver,  authoritarian approaches might become attractive,  consistent with the earlier discussion on the appeal of  dominant-type leaders.

NOTES 1 All differences between people perceiving very high human insecurity  and people perceiving low human insecurity are statistically significant at  the 1 percent level. 2 The index of perceived insecurity is built using a linear aggregation of in - security threats and cannot account for their subjective impact on people.  See UNDP (2022b).3 The higher sensitivity of wealthier groups to human insecurity is consistent  with the existence of endowment effects (Thaler 1980) — people living in a  context of high human security (both on an objective and subjective basis)  will tend to value more the benefits of a high human security environment  — and with loss aversion (Tversky and Kahneman 1991, p. 1047) — “losses  (outcomes below the reference status) loom larger than corresponding  gains (outcomes above the reference state).” In line with the idea that the  loss aversion theory can be context specific (Gal and Rucker 2018), the  text elaborates further about the meaning of loss in a context of a very  high HDI country. 156 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 PART II — SHAPING OUR FUTURE IN A TRANSFORMING WORLDAdvancing human  development in  uncertain timesCHAPTER 5 158 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022Uncertainty need not be paralyzing. In fact,  it presents opportunities to test the fences of  conventional thinking and to pursue reimagined  futures.  What do those opportunities look like today? How  big are they? As this chapter argues: huge.  Among the many things the Covid-19 pandemic  broke open was our imaginations, from revolutionary  vaccines to unprecedented fiscal and monetary  interventions. Rapidly evolving technologies, such  as artificial intelligence and synthetic biology, and  frontier ones, such as nuclear fusion, could usher  in a new era of prosperity for people and planet.  Opportunities abound. It is up to us to steer them  towards human development.CHAPTER 5 Advancing human development in uncertain times Uncertainty need not lead to negative outcomes. A  context of uncertainty and change can also alter the  reference for what is possible or desirable, opening  new opportunities to expand human development  along the four aspects of capabilities highlighted  in chapter 3: wellbeing achievements (typically the  dominant focus of assessments of progress and pol - icies), wellbeing freedoms, agency freedoms and  agency achievements. Transformational change happens against the  backdrop of the uncertainties discussed in part I.  Some of the implications associated with climate  change are daunting, as the most recent Intergovern - mental Panel on Climate Change assessments have  highlighted.1 But the ability of societies to respond  is not predetermined. A recent model of human be - haviour that looked at the interactions among social,  political, economic, technical and climate systems  found that interactions at the individual, communi - ty, national and global scales could lead to substantial  mitigation action.2 In fact, the reality of the Anthro - pocene is that human agency signals hope to con - sciously manage planetary ecosystems in a way that  eases planetary pressures.3 This chapter calls attention to the potential for ex - panding human development in uncertain times. It  argues that such an expansion can be leveraged in  part precisely because uncertain times provide a con - text where individuals and society see more funda - mental changes as possible or required. Uncertainty  itself can be a source of knowledge to be mobilized  to act differently,4 something that empowers indi - viduals and societies to adopt fundamental changes  in choices,5 that leads people to act according to new  moral codes6 and that can enhance cooperation when  it gives more salience to thinking about the future.7 It  has even been suggested that the greatest source of  political legitimacy may need to evolve beyond pro - cess legitimacy (complying with procedures that link  people’s aspirations and preferences to political de - cisions) and substantive legitimacy (delivering out - comes that matter to people). It can also come from  promissory legitimacy (justifying decisions and per - suading others to act based on claims about what the  future will hold).8 With democracy, uncertainty an - nounces the freedom to choose. By institutionalizing  an iterative and evolving configuration of winners  and losers, uncertainty over political outcomes keeps many different possibilities open, thereby supporting  pluralism and participation.9 Uncertainty can thus  help tap into people’s energy and appetite for change. Uncertainty forces us to make choices  — between  sticking to known paths and exploring new ones,  between yielding to paralysis and polarization or  tackling them head on.10 Both bleaker and more op - timistic scenarios may seem plausible, but the paths  are open and will be shaped by choices. Multiple nar - ratives are being discussed and debated about what  the future holds,11 and this diversity can be mobilized  to enable people to cooperate.12 When old ways of  doing things seem to no longer work and develop - ment pathways seem less obvious than in the past,  the opportunities for rethinking ideas and practices  open up.13 Uncertainty can provide fertile ground for  experimentation, innovation and purposeful trans - formation.14 In other words, it is possible to embrace  uncertainty and not be paralyzed by it.15 We can do  much today to ensure human thriving and flourish - ing, even in times of crisis and turbulence. “ It is possible to embrace uncertainty and  not be paralyzed by it. We can do much today  to ensure human thriving and flourishing,  even in times of crisis and turbulence This chapter considers some of those possibilities.  It explores the example offered by technological ad - vances, arguing that the context of uncertainty pro - vides a space for steering technological progress in  ways that advance human development. It also shows  that times of crisis can alter the horizon of what is  possible. Even amid significant failures, the Covid-19  pandemic has changed our reference points for what  we can achieve in many aspects of life. These are ex - amples of the new possibilities in today’s uncertain  world. Technological innovation  opens new possibilities Technological advances have been behind vast im - provements in human life and flourishing. They have  been the engine of economic growth  — powering the  Industrial Revolution, building cities and allowing  movement of people and goods. The printing press  and photography have expanded human knowledge.  CHAPTER 5 — ADVANCING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 159 Communication technologies have linked people  across vast distances, allowed for rapid dissemina - tion of information and expanded our social connec - tions in large-scale networks. Numerous innovations  in health, from anaesthetics to vaccines, have al - lowed us to live longer and healthier lives. However, technological innovation does not hap - pen in a vacuum, nor does it have a life of its own:  technology is us. Our social, economic and political  choices  — about where innovation can be directed, to  what priorities and to serve which people  — determine  how technology changes and how innovations ad - vance human development. Consider the sobering  case of vaccine deployment during the Covid-19 pan - demic. Advances in science and manufacturing al - lowed for multiple, highly effective vaccines against  Covid-19 to be developed in record time, in a remark - able feat of modern science. But amid a global fail - ure to share vaccines equitably, wide disparities have  emerged: by June 2022 less than 15 percent of people  in low-income countries had received a full protocol  of Covid-19 vaccines, compared with nearly 75 per- cent of people in high-income countries.16 Unequal  access to lifesaving vaccines has had a tragic toll on  human lives and wellbeing. “ Our social, economic and political choices  — about where innovation can be directed, to  what priorities and to serve which people  —  determine how technology changes and how  innovations advance human development This startling disparity in vaccine access reflects  in part patterns in the diffusion of technological in - novations. The share of the population that benefits  is small when a new technology is introduced; then  typically the share grows slowly at first, then increas - es very quickly after a threshold is reached and then  slows down as the share of the population with ac - cess approaches 100  percent  — in what is well known  in technology diffusion studies as an S curve. De - pending on the innovation at stake, often those with  higher income, power and social status benefit from  technological advancements first. This pattern is well  documented, in particular, for health innovations,17  in part because initial adopters have better access to  information.18 Disparities in health outcomes have  been found to increase for diseases with better tools for prevention and treatment, because people with  more resources are better able to use new knowl - edge.19 As such, an acceleration in new health-related  technology can worsen health gradients within and  between countries for a time, even as it eventually  drives improvements at large.20 In terms of Covid-19  vaccines, while the gap between richer and poorer  countries has decreased over time, there is still a long  way to go.21 The initial stage of the technological diffusion  process  — of remarkable improvements alongside  widening gaps  — is eventually closed, not only as tech - nological innovations become more affordable, but  also as complementary changes in economic and so - cial arrangements foster both greater benefits and  lower prices due to further diffusion.22 At the same  time, those excluded as the technology diffuses to a  larger and larger share of the population are doubly  disadvantaged, in that not only do they lack the ben - efits of the innovation, but they are also left outside  what is increasingly the norm. The ongoing digital  revolution is an example, promising to vastly improve  the world’s production possibilities but risking leav - ing a substantial proportion of people excluded and  ultimately worse off if insufficient attention is paid to  those exclusions.23 Past technological advances have generated great  disruptions alongside opportunities and deep anxi - eties about the future, as well as the promise of pro - gress to come. Rapid technological change is part of  the uncertainty complex gripping the world today.  New technologies are upending our economies and  societies, and many aspects of our social systems  will need to adjust before the vast potential of tech - nological innovation can advance human develop - ment. As argued in the 2019 Human Development  Report, these adjustments must unequivocally pay  attention to inequalities if another great divergence  is to be avoided.24 The shift from concentrated ac - cess and wide inequality to convergence over time  depends on social and political choices. Amid tech - nological change as rapid and destabilizing as we are  seeing today, the need for institutional and behav - ioural transformation becomes not only more salient  but also necessary and actionable. Periods of turbu - lence have prompted radical new policies in the past:  in Britain the Industrial Revolution saw far-reach - ing interventions to improve labour and working  160 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 conditions (including regulating work hours and  taxing incomes), which helped convert the structur - al change in the economy into improved opportunity  and wellbeing.25 The initial stages of diffusion are characterized by  growing inequality in access and typically also so - cial dislocation. But this context is an opportunity for  action: the choices made at this stage determine the  trajectory to come. Expanding human development  becomes even more important at this stage, with the  concern for inequalities at the centre, implying that  uncertain times need not be seen as an impediment  to action; rather, they provide a context in which new  possibilities for action emerge. Many of today’s hopes for positive transformational  change rely on technological innovations. New tech - nologies have helped deliver rapid advances in human  development. For instance, in health, antibiotics and  vaccines vastly improved life expectancy in just a few  decades in Africa, Asia, and Latin America; in Europe  the same improvement took well over a century, from  the early 1800s, when such technology did not exist.26  More recent technological advances have been crucial  for curbing human-induced pressures on the planet   — enabling more efficient land use, more sustainable  food systems and a transition away from fossil fuels.  Technological changes affect human capabilities in  multiple ways: they not only expand people’s ability  to do more things (as an enabler), but they also affect  our social context and people’s agency.27 Innovation is  more than new inventions or machines; it is about new  ideas for doing things and taking advantage of exist - ing resources to make those ideas come to fruition. In  this respect innovation is linked to agency  — people’s  ability to act on their values, ideas and priorities. It is  a broad process of transformation, where human initi - ative and creativity interact with social, economic and  political choices. Technological advances are offering  transformative potential Today, several developments in science and tech - nology signal the potential for far-reaching trans - formation. There have been major developments  in computing, biology and energy, as discussed in  chapter 1. These advances are occurring in what has been described as the exponential age, fostered by  remarkable improvements in computing power and  connections across people and machines.28 Expo - nential development in new technologies is not sim - ply about individual inventions  — it is the result of  several new technologies developing in parallel and  nourishing one another.29 In digital technologies  our capacity to generate innovations on the back of  old or existing technologies has greatly expanded.  Many important technologies today are standardized  and interoperable30 — that is, made compatible with  other technologies by design. The internet is based  on standard web protocols, and much modern soft - ware development relies on modular, standard code  blocks. These conditions help make breakthrough in - novations possible. “ Disruptive change in major technological  sectors has the potential to dramatically  alter societies and economies Economic and political conditions are an important  part of this picture. The availability of markets for  new goods and services, facilitated by trade and glo - balization, has helped new technologies diffuse wide - ly. This has enabled us to engage in learning by doing:  more production allows us to learn how to further im - prove the production process. This learning effect is  an essential driver behind the exponential develop - ment of solar power technology.31 Our networks for  sharing information are also larger and more com - plex than ever, facilitating flows of data, ideas and  know-how. Consider some factors that made Covid- 19 vaccines possible, such as global scientific collabo - ration, open data sharing and the release of the latest  research on preprint servers  — all capabilities based  on information networks.32 Spurred by the Covid-19  crisis, advances in mRNA vaccine technology are now  opening new possibilities for controlling disease.33 Disruptive change in major technological sectors  has the potential to dramatically alter societies and  economies. Many new technologies are general pur - pose, with applications beyond a single sector. Gen - eral purpose technologies are transformative because  they create new products and processes and new  ways of organizing economic activity. The general-   purpose technologies of today include new forms of  computing (such as artificial intelligence), among  CHAPTER 5 — ADVANCING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 161 many others, with a dizzying array of applications  for advancing human development. The following  sections consider some of the possibilities offered  by technological advances in energy, computing and  biology. That even the most beneficial advances often gen - erate negative consequences only heightens the  importance of purposefully managing technolog - ical disruption. Technological change is far from  deterministic  — the related risks and impacts and  the prospects for positive transformation are all ulti - mately shaped by social and political choices. Even as  rapid technological change fosters uncertainty, it also  opens space for action. There is enormous potential  to be realized, and with the right policies and actions  in place (as discussed in depth in chapter 6), the fu - ture should be one of remarkable gains for human  development. Renewable energy technologies are  getting better and cheaper Making progress on clean energy is essential for  breaking the patterns of human wellbeing improve - ments generating planetary pressures. Because en - ergy is so crucial to overall human development,  energy consumption is unlikely to ease in the near  future, particularly in developing countries. So, in  the absence of technological advancements towards  plentiful clean energy, there are few viable paths to  mitigating planetary pressures. On the technological front there are remarkable  positive signals both as outcomes and as processes.  New capacity additions were dominated by renew - able energy, accounting for 72 percent of additions  worldwide in 2019.34 The costs of renewable energy  technology and energy storage have declined dramat - ically in recent years. The price of utility-scale solar  photovoltaics dropped by 89 percent from 2009 to  2019 (figure 5.1).35 The price of lithium-ion batteries  has fallen by 97 percent since their commercial intro - duction in 1991.36 Maturing technology contributes  to cost and price reductions. For solar power tech - nology, installed capacity has increased exponential - ly, accompanied by exponential declines in the cost  of solar modules.37 Since the 1970s the unit costs of  solar photovoltaics have fallen by 24 percent each  time the cumulative installed capacity has doubled. The equivalent learning rate for lithium-ion batteries  has been around 20 percent.38 Other energy storage  technologies have followed similarly steep learning  curves.39 Batteries are also becoming smaller and  lighter. Between 1991 and 2018 the energy density  of lithium-ion batteries rose 3.4-fold.40 The dramat - ic cost reductions in renewable energy technologies  have consistently exceeded expectations: contra - ry to the projected average annual cost reduction of  2.6 percent between 2010 and 2020 (based on 2,905  global energy-economy models), solar photovoltaics  costs declined by 15  percent a year over the same pe - riod (figure 5.2).41 There have been major breakthroughs in nuclear  fusion. Leveraging nuclear fusion’s enormous poten - tial will require substantial innovations before it can  be deployed at scale. This transition will take time,  but recent developments provide some grounds  for optimism. There have been important advanc - es in some nuclear fusion experiments, and at least  three may soon generate energy gain factors (the  ratio of fusion power to externally applied heating  power) greater than 1  — the National Ignition Facil - ity and SPARC are expected to do so in the 2020s,  and ITER by 2040.42 In February 2022 scientists at  the Joint European Torus generated more than dou - ble the previous record for energy generated in a fu - sion reaction, a major step towards nuclear fusion  becoming a viable clean energy source.43 There are  also signs of new technologies interacting in ways  that can accelerate progress. Machine learning tech - niques are being used in the tokamak configuration  (a form of magnetic confinement used in nuclear fu - sion research).44 “ Making progress on clean energy is essential  for breaking the patterns of human wellbeing  improvements generating planetary pressures But the path forward is likely to be volatile in the  context of uncertainty that we confront today. Dur - ing the Covid-19 pandemic progress in clean energy  innovation may have been affected by pressures on  public and private budgets, creating a riskier environ - ment for clean energy venture capital and disrupting  global supply chains. Global carbon dioxide emis - sions declined by 5.8 percent in 2020, as the pandem - ic affected demand for oil and coal, but rebounded by  162 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 nearly 5 percent in 2021, approaching the 2018–2019  peak.45 Still, the pandemic could present a unique op - portunity to leverage clean energy innovation, given  the global demand for a greener recovery.46 New  players with new ideas aiming to displace high-car - bon producers and to scale up quickly may find a  supportive environment if they are able to enter the  market at the right moment. Economic stimulus  plans could be an opportunity to boost clean energy  technology innovation. This potential is being un - derused: a review of 75 International Monetary Fund  (IMF) programmes in 65 countries shows that the in - dicator for the green recovery is very low, at 0.59 (on  a scale of 0 to 3).47 Today, there is potential for expansion in this  area. The International Energy Agency’s Energy Technology Perspectives Clean Energy Technolo - gy Guide includes information on the maturity level  of more than 400 technology designs and compo - nents, as well as a compilation of cost and perfor - mance improvement targets and leading players in  the field.48 Some 5 percent of technology designs and  components analysed are at a mature stage. Around  60 percent are not commercially available today, and  35 percent are at the early adoption phase.49 Leveraging artificial intelligence for  augmentation of the demand for labour Rapid advances in computing over the past decade  have drawn attention to the possibilities of power - ful artificial intelligence (AI). Some of the biggest Figure 5.1 The cost of renewable energy has declined dramatically Levelized cost of energy ($/MWh) 0100200300 2009 2019 Coal –2% Solar photovoltaic –89%Onshore wind –70%Gas (combined cycle) –32%Solar thermal power –16%Nuclear +26%Gas peaker –37%The price of electricity from solar  declined by 89% in these 10 years.$359 $275 $168 $135 $123 $111 $83 $40$175 $41$141$155 $109 $56 The price of onshore wind electricity  declined by 70% in these 10 years.

CHAPTER 5 — ADVANCING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 163 opportunities for applying AI are in automation that  augments  — rather than replaces  — demand for human  tasks across various sectors of the economy. AI-based  systems are driving major technological develop - ments in several applications, such as autonomous  vehicles, medical diagnosis and inventory manage - ment, to name a few.50 This means that some tasks  can be performed by machines, but there is little  evidence that machines can replace whole occupa - tions.51 Instead, applications for machine learning (a  subset of AI) that have exploded in numerous fields  are opening an array of new possibilities for advanc - ing human wellbeing. For climate change, machine  learning is aiding in predicting disasters and model - ling climate change impacts, among many other ap - plications. In healthcare, machine learning is offering new ways to detect and diagnose disease.52 Machine  learning applications have the potential to improve  education outcomes through individualized learning  techniques and accessibility applications.53 Augmenting what humans can achieve by using  AI in a complementary way rather than substitut - ing what humans can do offers enormous promise  —  what people can achieve with these machines can be  greater than what people might achieve without them  (figure 5.3). AI applications can supplement human  cognitive tasks. For instance, there is evidence of  AI’s potential for supporting human decisionmaking  through teaching people cognitive strategies.54 By  augmenting the process of technological invention,  AI applications could vastly increase the rate at which  human capacities further expand.55Figure 5.2 Contrary to the projected average annual cost reduction of 2.6 percent between 2010 and 2020,  solar photovoltaics costs declined by 15 percent a year over the same period Capacity cost, 2020 ($/kW, log scale) Levelized cost of electricity, 2020 ($/MWh, log scale) IAM projections reported in 2014 Observed valueNumber of scenarios Improvement rate (%/year) Observed average photovoltaics cost Trend line, 1980–2020 High progress IEA projections High progress IAM projections, 2014 High progress IAM projections, 2018Observed average photovoltaics system cost Approximate photovoltaics system cost (2.5× observed photovoltaics module cost) IAM photovoltaics system ﬂoor costs (shade denotes year reported)1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 2030 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 2040104 103 102104 103 102105 203001,000 500 0 20 10  IAM is Integrated Assessment Model.

The pos - sibility of labour displacement is a source of anxie - ty, as it has been in previous waves of automation.56  AI-induced labour displacement could exacerbate  inequality, both within and between countries.57 But  AI also offers labour-enhancing potential.58 When  machines replace labour, workers’ bargaining power  and influence diminish; in contrast, when AI aug - ments human activity, people remain important for  value creation and continue to wield power and in - fluence. There is some evidence that the augmen - tation effects of introducing AI can outweigh the  effects of automation, but this requires appropri - ate incentives.59 Moreover, introducing technology  can generate new tasks and activities that demand  human labour.60 Most jobs performed today came  into being in part through the task-creating effects  of new technologies: in the United States around  60 percent of people are now employed in occu - pations that did not exist in 1940.61 Expanding AI  into the world of work could similarly generate  new tasks, new occupations and new industries  altogether.Harnessing synthetic biology Advances on several fronts are now propelling what  has been described the Synthetic Age, where biolog - ical systems can be redesigned and re-engineered  for a variety of useful purposes.62 Synthetic biology  builds on advances in multiple fields over the past  decade, including dramatic declines in the cost of  DNA sequencing and synthesis, the development of  sophisticated gene editing tools such as CRISPR and  high-powered computational tools.63 Redesigning organisms to have new abilities could  have numerous applications in health, agriculture,  manufacturing and ecosystem management. Synthet - ic biology is supporting new advances in medicine  —  for treating cancer,64 improving cell-based and gene  therapies65 and developing new drugs.66 In agriculture  there are now possibilities for engineering nitrogen fix - ation in crops and increasing crop resistance to pests  and pathogens.67 Potential applications of synthetic  biology in managing the environment include break - ing down pollutants68 and supporting biodiversity and  habitat restoration.69 There is also potential for devel - oping synthetic alternatives to fossil fuels.70Figure 5.3 Opportunities for augmenting human activity are far greater than opportunities to automate existing tasks Tasks that  humans can doHuman tasks that could be automated New tasks that  humans can do with  the help of machines Note: Figure is illustrative.

CHAPTER 5 — ADVANCING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 165 Times of change come with space  for purposeful intervention In addition to great opportunities, fast-changing  technologies also create new challenges: potential for  misuse, thorny political and ethical issues, and risks  from unintended and even unknown consequences.  For instance, synthetic biology applications such as  human genome editing involve urgent ethical ques - tions.71 Some of the challenges introduced by syn - thetic biology applications are unprecedented in  nature, such as the novel risks of introducing artificial  life forms. Expanding AI applications also introduces  considerable risks. AI and digitization more broad - ly can contribute to the concentration of wealth and  market power.72 Beyond the impact in some sectors  of the economy, using AI to assist human judgement  and predictions in several domains (health, educa - tion and governance to name a few) introduces new  risks, including of algorithmic bias and discrimina - tion (see chapters 1 and 2).73 “ Given the speed at which technological  advances are unfolding, there is the risk  that, without appropriate incentives  and regulation, new problems might  accumulate just as rapidly while long- standing ones are further exacerbated The potential of these technologies, coupled with  the new challenges they pose, increases the impor - tance of purposefully steering technological progress  in ways that expand human capabilities. Indeed,  given the speed at which technological advances are  unfolding, there is the risk that, without appropriate  incentives and regulation, new problems might accu - mulate just as rapidly while long-standing ones (such  as inequalities) are further exacerbated. Many new  technological advances reflect what has been consid - ered an era where societal implications are exceed - ingly complex and require sophisticated governance  and policymaking.74 New social and ethical ques - tions might unfold faster than appropriate responses  can be formed.75 Moreover, the Covid-19 pandem - ic has generated an enormous setback for human  development progress. It is in this context that the  double-  edged sword of technological change must be  wielded carefully.These conditions highlight the importance of pur - posefully advancing the full potential of new technol - ogies for human development. For instance, rather  than leaving the evolution of new technologies up to  markets or to the narrow incentives of a few actors  alone, actively steering new technologies towards  expanding human capacities is essential. Policy and  regulatory interventions are important in this respect,  as is a broader evolution of norms for responsible in - novation and avoiding harm. Opening spaces for  broad deliberation and overcoming the gulf between  technical and social debates on new advances will be  essential for advancing the human development po - tential of the disruptive new technologies.76 A context of uncertainty can provide the conditions  in which such actions become possible. Navigating  our current reality will require new ways of thinking.  In these conditions opportunities emerge to rethink  old ideas and practices and to experiment with dif - ferent ways of doing things. For instance, it has been  suggested that managing technological disruption  today demands rethinking competition policy and  antitrust regulation.77 Things that once appeared im - possible or infeasible are becoming possible in gov - ernance, science, technology and innovation. Indeed,  as the next section discusses, times of crisis can alter  our reference points for what we can achieve  — and  open new avenues for action in uncertain times. The Covid-19 pandemic:  A window into a new reality The Covid-19 pandemic has exerted a vast human  toll, not only through loss of life but also through  long-term damage to economies and communities.  It is the greatest global crisis in human development  since World War II. Harmonized information since  1950 for income per capita and life expectancy shows  the magnitude of the crisis and its global character in  historical perspective (figure 5.4): in 2020, 85 percent  of countries experienced a decline in income per cap - ita, and 70 percent of countries and territories faced a  reduction in life expectancy at birth. The comparison  of income and life expectancy also reminds us of the  importance of looking beyond income: despite signif - icant economic recovery in 2021, the health crisis in - tensified, with two-thirds of countries recording even  further reductions in life expectancy at birth. 166 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 The Covid-19-Adjusted Human Development  Index quantifies the depth of the crisis from a multi - dimensional perspective. The index retains the  standard Human Development Index (HDI) dimen - sions but modifies the expected years of schooling  indicator to reflect the effects of school closures and  the availability of online learning on effective at - tendance rates.78 The Covid-19 pandemic touched  nearly every person in the world, with all regions  facing declines (figure 5.5). In 2020 the world ex - perienced a loss in Covid-19-adjusted HDI value  equivalent to more than one-fifth of the progress  from 1990 to 2019. Latin America and the Caribbe - an was the most affected region, losing in one year  the equivalent of 30 percent of its pre-Covid-19 pro - gress since 1990. In 2021 there was a recovery, but it was partial  and uneven. For very high HDI countries the 2020 Covid-  19-adjusted HDI shock was not as large as  across other country groups, but it was more sus - tained, with a slow recovery in 2021. Crises on such a large scale hold up a mirror to so - cieties. Covid-19 has laid bare the vast prepandemic  disparities in people’s ability to cope with shocks to  access healthcare and to rebuild from loss. The pan - demic has exposed the fragilities in global coordi - nation mechanisms in pandemic preparedness and  response. The Independent Panel for Pandemic Pre - paredness and Response found “gaps and failings  at every critical juncture of preparedness”: contain - ment measures that were too slow, a lack of coordi - nated global leadership, emergency funding that  took too long to materialize, and large holes in social  protection systems.79 The unequal access to lifesav - ing Covid-19 vaccines demonstrated a tragic failure  of global solidarity.80 These failures played a role in Figure 5.4 The Covid-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented synchronized and multidimensional crisis 0102030405060708090 1951 1953 1955 1957 1959 1961 1963 1965 1967 1969 1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021Share  of countries and t erritories with a yearly reduction in income per capita (red) or life expectancy at birth (blue) (%) Reduction in life expectancy at birthEconomic contraction  (based on income per capita) Note: Based on countries with available data in each year.

CHAPTER 5 — ADVANCING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 167 the pandemic’s disproportionate impacts on people  around the world. Yet, even as crises mirror weaknesses and injus - tice, the current crisis also shows us that there are  opportunities. Wars, pandemics and disasters can  trigger far-reaching change. The 1918 flu pandemic  helped spur investments in medicine in some coun - tries, and the bubonic plague triggered efforts to im - prove sanitation and working conditions.81 At other  times shocks have fostered repressive or harmful  policies or not resulted in change.82 Opportunities  for positive transformations are context-specific  and far from inevitable (box 5.1). The next section  suggests that amid significant collective failures  the world’s response to the pandemic offers new  possibilities for transformation. In our response to  Covid-19 are new reference points for what we can  achieve in times of crisis  — triggering breakthrough technological innovation, delivering inclusive social  protection and changing social norms. New reference points for technological breakthroughs Less than two years after the novel coronavirus strain  was identified, multiple highly effective vaccines  against Covid-19 were deployed around the world.83  The availability of vaccines for Covid-19 was a cru - cial turning point. The speed of developing these  vaccines  — just 11 months after the SARS-CoV-2 se - quence was published  — is a remarkable achievement.  This outcome was made possible in part by years of  scientific work, including three decades of prior re - search into RNA-based vaccines, now deployed for  the first time to tackle Covid-19. The history of mRNA  vaccine development starts in the 1960s.84 But only Figure 5.5 Widespread but unequal declines in Covid-19-adjusted Human Development Index (HDI) value: Regional and  group aggregates 5.92.510.98.4 8.58.025.521.76.914.4 3.35.8 5.110.9 18.530.4 8.024.6 7.623.49.421.7 0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0 30.0 35.0Very high HDIHigh HDIMedium HDILow HDIArab States East Asia and the Paciﬁc Europe and Central Asia Latin America and the Caribbean South Asia Sub-Saharan AfricaWorld Loss in Covid-19-adjusted HDI since 2019 (% oftotal gain in 1990–2019)2020 2021 Note: The Covid-19-adjusted HDI retains the standard HDI dimensions but modifies the expected years of schooling indicator to reflect the effects of school  closures and the availability of online learning on effective attendance rates.

Commercial research and development started  only in the late 1990s, with the US Defense Advanced  Research Projects Agency financing a large part of  the research. This long history of development made  possible vaccine development from when the pan - demic started. Even as these advances in vaccine technology  built off a pre-existing foundation, the Covid-19 emergency injected an unparalleled sense of urgency  into scientific work, producing a systemic shift in sup - ply and demand. Addressing the pandemic through  vaccination became a mission, and vaccine supply  chains emerged.85 Moreover, thanks to the steady  reduction of DNA sequencing time, many coun - tries could receive current information on prevailing  strains of the virus and to act accordingly. Publication  pipelines worked overtime to keep up with the rapidly Box 5.1 The Covid-19 pandemic as an opportunity? A call for a contextual approach Do shocks create opportunities for policy change? How can the Covid-19 pandemic help ensure that in the future  most of the population has access to clean water, sanitation, healthcare, school services and other social benefits  as a matter of right? These questions have surfaced in the aftermath of a pandemic that upended all dimensions of  everyday life. Progressive policymakers, social activists and international organizations have identified the current  crisis as an opportunity to promote radical policy change. An important body of research identifies shocks as triggers for policy change. Pandemics have also generated  opportunities for change as early as the 14th century, contributing to the growth of public institutions and the modern  state.1 The extent to which pandemics have triggered opportunities for inclusionary change has depended at least  in part on the role of ideas — including scientific ideas — and how they have shaped the narratives regarding policy  responses. Each narrative is a story about a problem and its sometimes-obvious solution.2 Analytic frameworks that move beyond grand proclamations about how shocks enhance opportunities for inclusive  social policies can be useful. To determine whether such policies have created longer term opportunities, we propose  focusing on three key variables. First are the incentives that the policy tools themselves create.3 Second are the  responses to shocks that can also modify the distribution of power among state actors. Third are the narratives that  are particularly important as a mechanism for change — one that deserves special attention here. In this way ideas are  a power resource to define what the problem subject to state intervention is, frame possible and desirable outcomes  and lead policy implementation.4 Opportunities are context-specific and revolve around the combination of narratives, policy tools and pro-equity  state actors. Take the emergency cash transfers under the Bono Proteger programme, which buffered the sudden  loss of income in Costa Rica. The pandemic, along with high uncertainty and fear of social unrest, lifted constraints  and made space to implement new policy measures. The programme empowered state entities focused on advanc - ing social goals and created openings for new narratives and policy tools.5 A second lesson is that the pandemic may  leave as many challenges as opportunities when narratives of austerity, including the claim that more taxes are not  politically possible or even desirable, take hold. This reminds us of the power of the idea that states should live within their means, which often also implies that  they should avoid increasing taxes as much as possible. Austerity is as much a scientific idea as it is a moral impera - tive linked to moderation and sacrifice.6 It alters the relationship between the state and citizens and has become a  powerful tool against serious attempts towards redistribution.7 In recent decades, austerity has become appealing  for conservative political actors critical of the welfare state, because it is “politically more expedient to argue that the  government lives above its means than to directly attack the poor.”8 To further advance and fight this dominant narrative, much needs to change. The combination of state weaknesses  and pro-status quo actors (such as the economic elites) that ended up inhibiting rapid use of the opportunities cre - ated to expand inclusive social policy should be analysed further.

CHAPTER 5 — ADVANCING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 169 emerging research.86 The rate of Covid-19-related  therapies in research pipelines and the academic pub - lication rate of Covid-19 articles exceeded that of re - cent Ebola, Zika and H1N1 crises by at least an order  of magnitude.87 The success of vaccine development shows that  governments, industry and academia can work to - gether to great effect in a crisis. Regulatory processes  were deployed to support the acceleration of clini - cal development, trials and emergency use author - ization. Governments provided large investments  in manufacturing capacity and in supporting private  research and development. Manufacturing pipelines  were developed alongside clinical trials to allow for  rapid scale-up. Government investments helped sup - port development of several potential vaccine can - didates, increasing the odds that at least a few might  be successful. The United States and Germany were  the largest investors in vaccine research and develop - ment, providing about $2 billion and $1.5 billion re - spectively to pharmaceutical companies.88 Covid-19  also propelled major technological advances in our  ability to develop vaccines for future diseases: novel  RNA technology appears set to permanently trans - form how vaccines can be developed and manufac - tured in the future.89 New reference points for social  protection and economic policy In the more than two years since the SARS-CoV-2  virus was first identified, governments have adopted  new and unprecedented policy measures to protect  vulnerable populations and national economies from  lasting damage.90 Instruments of economic policy have been de - ployed at an extraordinary scale. In August 2021  the IMF issued $650 billion equivalent in new Spe - cial Drawing Rights, the largest in the fund’s history   — even if the process took much longer than what  would have been feasible. The new Special Drawing  Rights provided vital support for national economies  as governments battled the health and economic  damage the pandemic wrought. A G20-sponsored  Debt Service Suspension Initiative granted 73 coun - tries temporary relief on debt-service payments until  December 2021. Government fiscal responses were among the largest in recent history, totalling $16 tril- lion in support between April 2020 and April 2021.91  These resources were poured into helping house - holds and businesses survive the crisis through a  variety of instruments, including direct transfers, ex - panded benefits, payment deferrals and liquidity in - jections. To deliver these massive financial support  measures, governments moved to rapidly upgrade  existing social protection systems and develop new  facilities, such as for digital payments. “ The response to the Covid-19 pandemic has  reminded us how people-centric policies can  substantially enhance human wellbeing The response to the Covid-19 pandemic has also  reminded us how people-centric policies can sub - stantially enhance human wellbeing. As the pandem - ic’s economic, social and health impacts mounted,  governments around the world deployed a flurry  of expansive social protection measures to support  people through the crisis. More than 1,600 social  protection measures were reported across virtual - ly all countries and territories in February 2020 and  January 2021.92 The scope and scale of these meas - ures were unprecedented in many settings. In sever - al countries governments expanded protections for  losses of livelihoods and income (see monetary sup - port measures in figure 5.6). Many began to extend  direct transfers, in the form of cash payments and  guaranteed income. Where transfer programmes al - ready existed, governments increased benefits and  expanded coverage to include more recipients.93 By  the end of 2020, cash transfers had reached nearly  1.1 billion people worldwide, with coverage growing  by 240  percent on average relative to prepandemic  levels.94 By some estimates almost 17 percent of the  world’s people saw at least one Covid-19-related cash  transfer payment between 2020 and 2021.95 Several  countries delivered one-off payments to their pop - ulations on a universal or near-universal basis.96 In  addition to cushioning the blow of lost livelihoods,  income support programmes helped stem the spread  of Covid-19. In low-income countries income sup - port measures were found effective in reducing the  growth rate of Covid-19 cases, and in middle-income  countries they helped reduce both case growth rates  and deaths linked to Covid-19.97 170 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 Many social protection schemes saw unprecedent - ed expansions in scope, reaching groups that have  been excluded from support in the past, such as in - formal sector workers and the self-employed.98 Gov - ernments of several countries provided food aid,  delivering baskets of staples and essential foods to  households for free.99 Some suspended routine pay - ments and contributions, including for utility bills,  loans and pension schemes. Mobile payment systems  were deployed to deliver financial support — in Bang - ladesh, Jordan and Mali for instance  — to minimize  the need to visit banks and service providers in per - son. Countries turned to online application systems  to reach as many of their citizens as they could. Brazil  expanded coverage for households already registered  as potential beneficiaries and then registered about  27 million households within a few weeks through an  online system.100 Since Covid-19 triggered a public health crisis,  measures to expand health coverage were deployed  around the world (see health measures in figure 5.6).  Several countries sought to ensure that facilities to  identify, diagnose and treat Covid-19 were readily  available at low or no cost. Many countries sought to close gaps in health coverage by expanding existing  schemes to cover additional segments of their pop - ulations, such as temporary and migrant workers.  Paid sick leave and other forms of support were ex - panded, such as compensation for earnings lost due  to self-isolation and quarantine.101 These efforts reflected the urgency of the crisis,  and emergency measures are unlikely to remain in  place indefinitely, as figure 5.6 seems to confirm. But  they have demonstrated that inequalities and gaps  in social protection are not insurmountable. They  have shown that governments can do more to make  social protection a reality. And they have shown that  interventions in income security and healthcare in  particular can make an enormous difference to peo - ple’s lives. The Covid-19 pandemic may have helped  broaden public appreciation for social protection and  improve government experience with delivering it.  And it has added to a growing evidence base on the  effectiveness of relatively untested social protection  measures, such as guaranteed basic incomes. The Covid-19 pandemic has also brought previous - ly neglected concerns to the forefront of the reform  agenda. Bridging digital disparities has become more Figure 5.6 Most countries implemented monetary support and health measures during the Covid-19 pandemic 0102030405060708090100 January 2020July 2020January 2021July 2021January 2022July 2022Share o f countries (%) Monetary supportHealth measures Note: Figure tracks the “flow” of active policies across around the world, displaying the percentage of countries that had any active monetary and  health measures in any given month during the Covid-19 pandemic.

CHAPTER 5 — ADVANCING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 171 urgent than ever, as the pandemic made affordable  internet access essential for education as schools  closed (recognizing, though, that it should not be  seen as a replacement for in-person education). Gov - ernments around the world ramped up e-government  facilities to continue delivering essential government  services, manage new demands (including adminis - tering expanded social protection programmes) and  provide dedicated Covid-19 information portals.102  Living with Covid-19 is providing new impetus to  digitalization efforts, bolstered by a renewed aware - ness that going online can create new possibilities for  public administration and that strengthening internet  access and infrastructure could be essential for resil - ience against future disasters.103 Tools such as nowcasting (providing real-time in - formation about economic and social processes as  they unfold, as opposed to waiting for official statis - tical information) are already gaining traction in ef - forts to understand and respond to the fast-moving  crisis presented by Covid-19. Alternative data sources  such as mobility data, congestion data, mobile pay - ment patterns and internet search activity are being  incorporated into models for understanding outbreak  patterns and economic activity.104 This spate of policy activism, through ramped up  social protection and new delivery mechanisms, may  have reset public expectations of what governments  are able to do, at least for some people. If sustained,  a new mindset about what governments can do for  people opens new possibilities to transform econom - ic policy thinking and approaches as we confront the  challenges ahead. New reference points for altering norms and behaviour Covid-19 showed us that people all over the world are  willing to dramatically alter their everyday conduct in  service of a common purpose. Although responses to  the Covid-19 pandemic became the focus of divisions  in society sometimes associated with political polari - zation, as discussed in chapter  3, there was remarka - ble and unprecedented behavioural and institutional  change. Combating the spread of Covid-19 required  a range of social and behavioural changes such as so - cial distancing, contact tracing, masking and restric - tions on gatherings. These changes could not have been sustained without voluntary cooperation from  the vast majority of the world’s population. A sur - vey of people in 58 countries during the early stages  of the pandemic showed high voluntary compliance  with several behavioural measures: 91 percent of re - spondents reported that they did not attend any so - cial gatherings, 78 percent said that they stayed home  in the week before the survey and 93 percent said  that they would have informed people around them if  they experienced Covid-19 symptoms.105 A different  study of pandemic-related behaviour in 28 countries  in August 2020 found that 58 percent of respondents  reported always or frequently avoiding having guests  in their homes and that 78 percent reported always or  frequently avoiding crowds.106 “ Covid-19 showed us that people all over the  world are willing to dramatically alter their  everyday conduct in service of a common purpose Behaviours that were exceedingly rare in many  societies becoming commonplace, such as wearing  masks, suggests the emergence of new social norms.  This means that people are motivated not only by  the need to protect themselves but also by a sense  of shared responsibility, a perception that others are  doing the same or the possibility of social disapprov - al for noncompliance. People in several countries  reported feeling proud of their contribution to stop - ping the spread of Covid-19 and believing that they  were setting a good example by wearing a mask.107 A  variety of interventions based on new social norms  engendered by Covid-19 can be considered for fu - ture disease control, including normalizing paid sick  leave, voluntary social distancing and self-isolation in  the event of exposure to infection.108 *   *   * The foreseeable future remains one of uncertainty.  Social upheaval, climate and environmental crises  and rapidly changing technology may be here to stay  for some time. The Covid-19 pandemic has given us  a glimpse of the kinds of reality we may need to con - front. It has also shown us who we are in times of cri - ses, how we can mobilize with a sense of common  purpose and how we may yet shape our common des - tiny. The extent to which we succeed in this era of un - certainty is up to us. 172 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 Our ability to manage this new reality will be  strengthened only with a new resolve for far-reaching  change. The pandemic has disrupted the world, and  it is unlikely, even undesirable, that things will return  to how they once were. And there is much more left to  do. Our response to the crisis has shown us some of the  possibilities for ensuring that the world will be more  just and resilient. We have seen that it is possible to  substantially reorient people’s relationships with gov - ernments and that this reorientation can deliver enor - mous improvements to people’s lives. The pandemic  showed that social protection can work better where  it corresponds to how people actually live, work and navigate times of crisis. We saw how people possess an  immeasurable capacity to care for one another  — and  how our ties to one another provide an invisible infra - structure for human flourishing. We saw also that our  ability to spur technological innovation can dramati - cally expand our possibilities for surviving and thriv - ing. More than any single technology or invention,  it is our capacity for innovation at large that matters  the most. Technological advances will be vital for the  structural changes needed in our economies and soci - ety. The direction of technological change remains up  to us, and much can be achieved by turning its poten - tial to tackle the challenges we face. CHAPTER 5 — ADVANCING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN UNCERTAIN TIMES 173  Charting paths to  transformation Navigating uncertainty to expand  human development PART II — SHAPING OUR FUTURE IN A TRANSFORMING WORLDCHAPTER 6 176 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022CHAPTER 6 Charting paths to transformation:   Navigating uncertainty to expand human development The hero and the villain in today’s uncertainty story  is one and the same: human choices. So, what practical choices can be made for the  better? This chapter emphasizes policies that focus on the  Three I’s: investment, insurance and innovation.  Together, these will promote, protect and stimulate  human development for people and planet to flourish  in the face of new uncertainties. Culture plays a big role, too. The chapter identifies  three enablers of cultural change: education to  cultivate evolving values, social recognition to  legitimize them and representation to protect their  inclusiveness and translate them into policies. Enhancing human development—by expanding free - doms and achievements in wellbeing and agency—is  an open-ended process filled with new possibilities.  Uncertainty is part of that journey, and as human in - genuity pushes forward the frontier of the possible,  new unintended consequences are bound to arise,  good and bad. And new challenges can mean room  for new opportunities. To thrive under uncertainty,  as important as averting the negative consequences  of well-intended actions, is to grab the opportunities  that emerge. Today we seem to be living through several un - intended consequences of progress, as reflected in  part in the three layers of uncertainty—the danger - ous planetary changes in the Anthropocene, the un - predictability in uncharted transitions, and the social  division and polarization of societies. Our choices  and the values that underpin them have at times pro - moted socially, economically and environmentally  unsustainable policies and development paths. Ine - qualities have allowed a few to benefit while many get  left behind. “ Our choices and the values that underpin  them have at times promoted socially,  economically and environmentally  unsustainable policies and development paths The image of the “empty box” in chapter 1, with  no country so far achieving a very high Human De - velopment Index (HDI) value with low pressures on  the planet, suggests that our societies need to devise  new ways of pursuing development. Chasing higher  GDP per capita or even higher HDI values alone is  not enough. The call is thus for transformational change, which  requires enhancing social arrangements to address  people’s insecurity and unsettledness. But this pro - vides only a partial response. We are not confront - ing a small adjustment or transitory imbalance. We  are navigating uncharted territory, where social and  planetary systems are adjusting simultaneously. The  assumption in much economic analysis that all other  conditions remain unchanged does not hold. Transformational change may be needed be - yond policies and institutional arrangements. Soci - eties also might need to shift social norms, beliefs  and values (introduced in chapter 3 as culture). The Dasgupta Review on the economics of biodiversity  argues for ensuring that societies’ demands on nature  do not exceed nature’s sustainable supply, for adopt - ing different metrics of economic success and for  transforming our institutions and systems—particu - larly those in finance and education—to enable these  changes and sustain them for future generations.1 But  the review goes further, coming to a startling conclu - sion: “No social mechanism can meet this problem  in its entirety, meaning that no institution can be de - vised to enforce socially responsible conduct.”2 The problem is that humans are embedded in na - ture, so current and future wellbeing depends on  maintaining the integrity of the biosphere, yet peo - ple’s conduct is undermining that very integrity. As  if this were not challenging enough, the Dasgupta  Review argues that “unlike the economics of cli - mate change, […] the economics of biodiversity […]  requires not only national and intergovernmental en - gagement, but engagement by communities and civil  societies throughout the world.”3 How, then, can such  a problem be solved? If these conclusions are star - tling, the recommendation on what to do may seem  even more so: “It would seem then that, ultimately,  we each have to serve as judge and jury for our own  actions. And that cannot happen unless we develop  an affection for Nature and its processes.”4 Social mechanisms to address collective problems  usually rely on appealing to people’s interests (such  as price incentives to tax pollution) or creating in - stitutions (property rights over land or a specific re - source, such as a forest). Interests and institutions  clearly matter, but the headline recommendation of  the Dasgupta Review can be interpreted to take us to  the world of ideas—or of culture (chapter 3). And why invoke the relevance of ideas, of culture,  now? Many communities in history have had a deep  affection for nature. Chief Elesi of Odogbolu living in  Nigeria stated in 1917: “I conceive that land belongs  to a vast family of which many are dead, few are liv - ing and countless others unborn.”5 The 2020 Human  Development Report documented how indigenous  peoples over time have held—and today in many  communities around the world continue to hold—be - liefs and values that reflect “an affection for Nature  and its processes.”6 Many are persecuted and killed  when their actions based on such beliefs come into  conflict with interests shaped by existing institutions,  CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION 177 from mining to expanding agriculture.7 But now  the challenges that we confront go beyond climate  change and preserving the integrity of biodiversity  functions: these are but two of the manifestations of  our Anthropocene context. In addition to dangerous planetary change, the  other layers of uncertainty documented in this Re - port are unsettling people’s lives. The conflicts that  play out at the local level between indigenous peoples  and firms or authorities are a microcosm of a broader  set of tensions that may not be resolved by arbitrating  between competing interests. It seems reasonable to  suggest, in addition to re-examining policies and in - stitutions (which is typically the remit of work such as  the Human Development Report), that the cultural  context—the ideas, broadly defined to include prac - tices, beliefs, norms, values and technologies—also  bears re-examining to explore a way forward as we  navigate today’s uncertain world. Examining culture opens new vistas for the range of  possible actions by those in positions of power and the  potential for new social mechanisms to address the  unprecedented challenges we are confronting today.  But that requires two things. First is broadening our  perspective on the determinants of people’s choices.  And second is reflecting on more recent perspectives  about what culture is, how it changes across contexts  and over time and how it is used by people in strategic  ways, rather than as a fixed latent variable working si - lently in the background. Key for both is recognizing  the importance of agency and freedom, the tenets of  the human development approach (chapter 3). A framework to embrace uncertainty Navigating the uncertainty complex demands dou - bling down on human development to ensure that  people have the capabilities to harness the poten - tial embedded in uncertain times. “The cunning  of uncertainty opens new spaces and facilitates the  emergence of alternative options. Ambiguities per - mit boundary crossings where closure between  knowledge domains or areas of strictly defined ex - pertise have reigned. Ambiguities do not mean that  everything becomes fuzzy and porous or that any - thing goes. They mean acknowledging that social life  is full of contradictions and that social beings have  the ability to navigate between them. Once they have the necessary resources, they also negotiate with  each other viable options for living together.”8 “ Navigating the uncertainty complex demands  doubling down on human development to ensure  that people have the capabilities to harness  the potential embedded in uncertain times We propose a two-tier framework to respond to  a dual gap in our uncertain times. On the one hand,  a mismatch between current social arrangements  struggling to promote human security and to tack - le people’s unsettledness. On the other hand, a mis - match between prevalent beliefs and values and what  might be needed to navigate through the uncertainty  complex (figure 6.1). The first tier is about what to do, with a focus on  concrete transformations on three fronts: invest - ment, insurance and innovation. • Investment, in the capabilities people will need to  enable socioeconomic and planetary conditions for  human flourishing. • Insurance, to protect people from the unavoidable  contingencies of uncertain times, safeguarding  their capabilities, including their fundamental  freedoms (enhancing human security). • Innovation, to foster capabilities that might not  exist today. The second tier is about how to generate the broad - er social and contextual conditions for change to take  hold, acknowledging the role of culture as described  in chapter 3. • Education, to strengthen agency and encourage  people to shape their own future. • Recognition, to acknowledge human rights and  respect for people’s identities and values to change  scripts and narratives that build hope in society. • Representation, to amplify the power and voice  that strengthen representation and agency. Insights from cultural change suggest cultivating  motivating principles that can both enhance social ar - rangements and shape cultural evolution in uncertain  times.9 The motivating principles highlighted in this  Report are flexibility, creativity, solidarity and inclu - sion (spotlight 6.1). No single set of policy recommendations can suit  every context and every country, but using these princi - ples as a compass can help navigate through the layers  178 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 of uncertainty and inspire people to embrace uncer - tainty. Flexibility, creativity, solidarity and inclusion  build pathways to transformation by strengthening re - silience10 and agency,11 as they increase communities’  capacity to thrive in environments characterized by  change. For instance, in the context of societal respons - es to Covid-19 in the G7 countries, differences in soli - darity and agency were much more marked than in the  economic and environmental policies pursued, point - ing to the importance of supplementing economic poli - cies with solidarity- and agency-enhancing actions.12 Investment, insurance and  innovation towards continually  expanding human development Thriving under uncertainty is possible. Three policy  building blocks that would shape transformations to expand human development could provide support  in facing the layers of uncertainty from dangerous  planetary change, uncharted transitions and polari - zation. The first is investment, encompassing people  and financial and natural resources. The second is  insurance mechanisms that guarantee protection or  compensation in the case of shocks or threats ema - nating from planetary imbalances or insecurities and  that can bring a greater sense of control. The third  is innovation, to embrace change, looking for new  solutions through creativity, iterative learning and  diverse perspectives. Investment, insurance and in - novation all safeguard and promote agency, thus ad - vancing human development. Implementing these  mechanisms aims to grow opportunities for the fu - ture while advancing human potential in the present.13  Figure 6.2 identifies some of the policy examples ex - plored below.Figure 6.1 A two-tier framework for transformation Cultural mismatches  (values, beliefs and social norms)Gaps Responses Investment Insurance InnovationEducation Recognition RepresentationInadequate institutions  and policiesPlanetary change Transition uncertainty PolarizationThree layers of uncertainty: Changing culture  (values, beliefs and  social norms)Enhancing social  arrangementsMotivating principles: ﬂexibility, creativity,  solidarity and inclusion Source: Human Development Report Office. CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION 179 Investment—in capabilities to  thrive under uncertainty The first building block encompasses investment in  the capabilities required to successfully navigate an  uncertain future. It includes policies focused on en - hancing capabilities as well as on forming the assets  to do so—meaning different forms of capital, includ - ing natural capital. The context of multilayered uncertainties sets  up new challenges but also new possibilities for the  long-standing aspiration to provide global public  goods.14 On the challenges the three layers of un - certainty render investments in global public goods  more difficult: the planetary scale of the Anthropo - cene’s challenges generates a mismatch with the  geographic scope of national governments,15 while  political polarization and transition uncertainty com - plicate how domestic priorities are weighed against  international challenges. This was made starkly clear  during the Covid-19 pandemic, as the world strug - gled and failed to ensure universal access to personal  protective equipment and then vaccines, despite hav - ing the scientific, technological and financial capaci - ties to make the investments needed to do so.16 But the uncertainty complex also makes the case  for investing in providing global public goods more  compelling. The additional investment to avoid fu - ture pandemics is estimated to be $15 billion a year.17 This is a tiny fraction of the economic cost of the  Covid-19 pandemic (without considering any human  cost in lives lost or learning lost): more than $7 tril - lion in lost production and more than $16.9 trillion in  emergency fiscal responses.18 The investment is also  very small compared with the $650 billion dollar is - suance of special drawing rights.19 The rational case  for investing in global public goods has been made  many times, as has the need to craft appropriate ar - rangements that sustain international coordination  or cooperation.20 But with the recognition of the uncertainty com - plex lies the opportunity to look across the interac - tions of the layers of uncertainty and not only work  through formal existing structures and rules but also  encourage experimentation and innovation.21 This  can be advanced by recognizing that providing global  public goods in a context of novel uncertainty can be  enhanced with institutions of multilevel governance  offering compelling narratives that foster coopera - tion and coordination through the legitimacy of en - visioning better futures.22 These institutions would  embrace uncertainty, which means adopting policies  and strategies robust to many alternative futures.  Normative goals—if formulated with participation,  flexibility to iterate and informed rigorous research— could help produce assessments that offer more ro - bust policy options beyond just alerting the world of  the extreme possibilities to come.23 They could be Figure 6.2 Making people more secure though investment, insurance and innovation Opportunities for broad participation Macroprudential policies Social protection  Access to basic services Protection of human rights Public deliberationAdaptive peacebuilding Social innovation Addressing misinformation and enhancing media literacy Data and measurementsEnergy eﬃciency Insurance InnovationInvestmentProvision of global public goods Nature-based human development Preparation to face environmental changes Source: Human Development Report Office. 180 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 even more robust if these assessments took a holis - tic view, focusing on the behaviour of the individual  components and agents in socioecological systems as  well as their interactions and relationships.24 Investment is also essential in complex governance  systems (governmental and beyond) that can exper - iment, respond quickly, draw on all relevant knowl - edge and account for heterogeneity of societies, while  overcoming the power imbalances that entrench vested interests. This would promote inclusion and  build trust for sustained collective action and solidari - ty (box 6.1). Investing in governance also means craft - ing systems that can redress inequality and provide  individual and group recognition to enable dignity by,  among other things, strengthening social policies and  fostering civic (re)engagement and participation.25 Investment is also needed in nature-based human  development, including bottom-up efforts that rely  Box 6.1 Governance for systemic and transformational change The Anthropocene represents a complex set of crises of a kind humanity has not previously confronted. Human  impact on the planet and unsustainable economic and social systems virtually guarantee environmental and societal  upheaval for the foreseeable future. Every polity will experience the effects for generations to come.  Complexity theory helps us understand what it takes to manage such systemic problems: holistic analysis, constant  experimentation and the inclusion of many disciplines and perspectives. But our existing governance processes  are designed largely to sort people and issues into siloed boxes onto which “optimal” procedures can be applied,  sandpapering away the diversity and volatility that characterize reality. It is entirely possible to govern for the complex systemic problems we confront.1 Such governance must focus not  just on the behaviour of individual components and actors in interrelated systems but also on their interactions and  relationships.2 It must adopt policies and strategies that are robust to alternative futures and adaptable in the face of  rapid change. Specifically, it must aim to (re)build social capital at scale, build meaningful networks across decision  silos and create effective, inclusive layers of governance that keep decisionmaking as close to local knowledge  as possible. To those ends governance should be based on four principles: systemic thinking, transparency, social  inclusion and subsidiarity. The most important change that Anthropocene governance requires is the shift to systemic thinking and decision - making. Some of the actions decisionmakers can take are mapping the system using social or organizational network  analysis;3 employing tools such as scenario-based planning for a variety of alternative outcomes and conditions;4 and  continuously monitoring, evaluating and assessing the impact of policies. Transparency in governance refers to the degree to which information is available to all stakeholders and enables  them to have an informed voice in decisions and assess the choices made by insiders.5 It is essential both for ac - countability and for making governance effective and responsive, as meaningful transparency permits feedback on  how well policies and experiments are working and what adaptations may be needed. Inclusion in governance refers to expanding meaningful participation to a wide array of stakeholders and ensuring  they have both deliberative and decisionmaking powers. Governance must prioritize inclusivity for three reasons: it  is necessary for reducing power imbalances, networks with a diverse and distributed structure are more resilient to  shocks and disruptions, and greater inclusion fosters legitimacy. Subsidiarity made possible by adequate transparency and inclusion then becomes a key principle for creating re - silience in a multilayered governance structure. It refers to how “social and political issues should be dealt with at the  most immediate level consistent with their adequate resolution.”6 If practised well, governance based on subsidiarity  can bolster the efficacy and legitimacy of policy responses because local authorities tend to be physically closer,  more connected and more visible to the people they serve. Governance based on these principles gives humanity its best shot at effectively and justly transforming the exist - ing systems for creating, using and disposing of the material substrate of human society. Such governance has the  potential to shift us towards greater adaptability, to strengthen the societal trust that is key to effective governance in  challenging times and to improve prospects for sustainable development in the Anthropocene.

CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION 181 on the inclusion, participation and knowledge of local  communities and indigenous peoples,26 leveraging  their potential to both learn and scale up transform - ative change.27 Examples include investing in green  areas to manage the risk of extreme temperatures,  reducing ecosystem-based disaster risk, improving  water quality, ensuring water availability and improv - ing agricultural practices to ensure food security. The  value of these efforts often goes beyond the contribu - tions to communities. So, instead of treating them as  isolated initiatives, countries should integrate them  into national development priorities across domains,  including water security, food security, disaster risk  reduction and economic performance. Nature-based  human development both relies on and can enhance  the agency of local communities and indigenous peo - ples; it also provides for diverse visions of what is a  good life, incorporates justice and inclusion in con - servation and promotes education and knowledge  sharing.28 “ Investing in mechanisms that prepare local  communities to face rapid environmental changes  such as food insecurity can increase agency and  freedoms by fostering inclusion and solidarity Investing in mechanisms that prepare local com - munities to face rapid environmental changes29 such  as food insecurity can increase agency and freedoms  by fostering inclusion and solidarity (spotlight 6.2). Insurance—against the interacting  layers of uncertainty Insurance guarantees protection or compensation  against shocks emanating from the interacting layers  of uncertainty. A key goal is to enhance human se - curity. As chapter 4 describes, human insecurity not  only constrains agency and fundamental freedoms  but also hinders collective action. People have always  confronted adverse outcomes—illness, death or in - juries that preclude someone from providing for the  household—and extended families, friends and local  communities have often been a source of support. Charities or religious institutions have some - times helped. Groups engaged in dangerous occu - pations such as mining established mutual societies for an injured or incapacitated member of the group  to receive support from the others, and some mar - ket insurance eventually developed out of these  arrangements. It is critical to expand market insurance, under  properly regulated frameworks that protect users and  address several of the well-known market failures in  insurance markets (including moral hazard and ad - verse selection). Equally important, market insur - ance providers will face the challenge of innovating  to offer services that address the novel context of un - certainty, for which existing actuarial practices may  not be fully adequate. It is also crucial to expand, and innovate in, social  insurance. Over the 20th century government-fund - ed social insurance programmes expanded around  the world. Public social welfare spending in Organi - sation for Economic Co-operation and Development  (OECD) countries grew from a median of 0.4 percent  of GDP in 1900 to 18.6 percent in 2017 . Private (man - datory and voluntary) social welfare spending has also  increased in recent decades, from a median of 1.1 per- cent of GDP in OECD countries in 1980 to 2.1 percent  in 2017—reaching more than 10 percent in the Neth - erlands, Switzerland and the United States.30 There is great diversity across countries in the level  and categories of spending, in the mix of taxation to  fund government programmes and in the reliance  on private provision. But the bulk of the increase in  OECD countries is related to contributory social in - surance programmes to support older people and to  pay for healthcare expenses, with both workers and  employees contributing to fund government pro - grammes. Denmark and New Zealand rely, instead,  on general tax revenues only. Most striking, howev - er, is how much less spending there is in non-OECD  countries: total social protection spending increased  from a median of 4.5 percent of GDP in 2000 to only  6.3 percent in 2015 in 46 countries that account for  most of the world’s population. In several African  countries less than 3 percent of the population living  in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution  is expected to rely on support from governments or  nongovernmental organizations—and the rest were  most likely to rely on family and friends (box 6.2).31 Macroprudential measures can be implemented  to promote financial stability, in part learning from  the lessons of the global financial crisis. Most central  182 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 banks have stability objectives, and they apply dif - ferent tools that work as insurance instruments to  build resilience.32 The most common mechanisms are  countercyclical capital buffers and capital require - ments, which serve as a shock absorber, sector-spe - cific capital requirements for the banking sector, and  loan-to-income or loan-to-value ratios that increase  bank capital above the minimum.33 Although in most  countries these instruments are under the Central  Bank’s control, in some (such as Brazil and South Af - rica) decisionmaking responsibility is shared. Not all  countries have the same mechanisms available—for  example, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia,  Peru and Türkiye use other prudential instruments  such as reserve or cash requirements on domestic de - posits. Reducing the costs of future systemic shocks  and containing vulnerabilities require building mac - roeconomic prudency and coordinating with mone - tary policy.34 Approaches such as state-contingent debt instru - ments can help economies respond to shocks quickly  and predictably. These instruments enable countries  to manage their sovereign debt payments depending  on changes in their capacity to pay as a direct result of  shocks.35 Mexico, Nigeria and Venezuela have linked  these instruments to commodity prices (such as oil prices); Argentina, Greece and Ukraine have linked  them to GDP variations; and Barbados and Grenada  have linked them to the effects of natural hazards.  State-contingent debt instruments act as insurance  that gives countries the space to apply countercyclical  and stabilization policies that are immediately trig - gered after well-specified adverse events take place.  After the event, and by contract, either the maturity  or the volume of payments to creditors (or both) is ad - justed to give more fiscal space to the sovereign debt - or. Creditors can count on a predictable response as  specified in the contract, as opposed to being subject  to ad hoc and unpredictable processes of potential  debt restructuring.36 Access to financial services can greatly contribute  to people’s abilities to navigate changing and uncer - tain economic conditions. Financial inclusion can re - duce poverty and inequality through access to credit  and insurance.37 Moreover, digital banking and pay - ment, loan and credit services enable wider finan - cial inclusion, especially among underserved groups  and in low- and middle-income countries.38 Financial  literacy is an important accompaniment to greater  financial inclusion because it develops tools, knowl - edge, confidence and awareness related to person - al and business finances. Important state-led and Box 6.2 The heightened importance of expanding and innovating in social protection Expanding and improving social insurance, recognized as important for a while, acquire heightened relevance in  today’s uncertain times. Social insurance enhances human security and can stimulate risk taking and investment,  supporting other elements of institutional change and policies. The reverse also holds: some investments can provide  insurance. For instance, investments in nature-based human development can be an effective tool for achieving  resilience to shocks.1 Key policies in this area relate to social protection2 that can shield people against shocks, achieving a dual purpose:  protection and promotion.3 The need to balance both raises questions about the appropriate mix of targeted and  universal policies. The interaction of inequalities, hierarchical power imbalances, polarization and conflicts can com - plicate reaching consensus for social policies.4 Social protection income and providing public goods can reduce in - equality while preventing political polarization, potentially reversing entrenched polarized attitudes.5 So it is important  to deliver mechanisms that reach everyone, independent of economic status. For instance, a social protection model  that was born to tackle social protection simultaneously with climate adaptation and disaster risks is adaptative social  protection.6 Adaptative social protection builds safety nets (savings, insurance, information) to prepare households to  act on unforeseen situations, so they can smooth consumption, retain assets and reduce exposure to shocks.7 Notes 1. Dasgupta 2021; DeFries 2020; UNDP 2020a.  2. Social protection is concerned with protecting and helping those who are poor, marginal - ized or dealing with increased risks. Social protection includes a set of measures provided by the state, such as social assistance (noncontrib - utory transfers in cash, vouchers, in-kind, free waivers and subsidies), social insurance, social care services and labour market programmes  (Carter and others 2019).  3. Drèze and Sen 1989.  4. Ravallion 2017.  5. Stewart, Plotkin and McCarty 2021.  6. Arnall and others 2010; Bahadur  and others 2015; Davies and others 2013.  7. Bowen and others 2020. CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION 183 private initiatives exist to strengthen these capabili - ties—for example, by incorporating financial literacy  content in education curricula.39 One of the main challenges policymakers face is in - adequate coverage of the people most likely to be left  behind. Targeted social policies that are based on in - come can easily exclude informal workers. Such pol - icies might have requirements that leave individuals  at higher risk of slipping through the cracks.40 With  these challenges combining with other recent threats,  such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the focus of the de - bate has shifted more to universalism. An example  to take advantage of the structures that have already  been built is the implementation of systems that ben - efit all, such as universal access to health, education,  care or income.41 A minimum guaranteed income has been tested  through pilot projects in India, Kenya and Namibia.42  One of the main operational challenges for these pro - grammes is that they are financed by taxation, and  countries with lower incomes have limited formal tax  systems and income data.43 Another concern is that  a minimum guaranteed income does not provide an  integrated solution across other human development  dimensions, so it could divert resources from other  government-subsidized or universal services, such as  education, and distort economic incentives. Howev - er, a universal basic income needs to be seen not only  in the context of the world today—in which limited  government resources and acute needs may tilt the  argument towards targeted transfers—but also as pre - paring for the world of tomorrow, when the nature of  future work may change.44 Many have advocated shifting the debate towards  universal basic services, to guarantee that everyone  meets their basic needs and has expanded opportu - nities and participation independent from contin - gencies.45 Universal access to services can still lead  to inequalities in human development. And as the  recent Special Report on Human Security points out,  universalism must consider equity and quality and  not just cover essential needs.46 In some countries  health and education are already built on universal  basic service principles, but this can be expanded to  housing, care, transportation, information, securi - ty and nutrition.47 Universal access to mental health  services48 enables people to deal with mental distress  and thrive, and these services could be offered within existing social structures, such as schools and com - munity centres. “ Good practices in promoting human rights  point towards identifying what binds us  together and engaging people in dialogue  about human rights in their daily lives Universal basic services are also based on solidar - ity, as it recognizes that needs and the responsibili - ty to fulfil them are shared in the collective. A study  of 19 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean  determined that policies across the region explicitly  mention that no child or adolescent should be left  out of the education system and designed method - ologies based on the Universal Design for Learn - ing.49 In El Salvador’s Modelo Escuela Inclusiva de  Tiempo Pleno, flexible pedagogic programmes were  adapted for different students based on inclusion  principles.50 The study also highlights that the chal - lenge for inclusive education is achieving not just a  technical change but also a social change. When ap - proaching universal policies in practice, it is impor - tant to consider all actors (teachers, administrators,  parents), create local support networks and trans - form the institutional culture with a shift in attitudes  and norms.51 Protecting human rights can work as insurance by  shielding people in times of uncertainty (box 6.3).  Mechanisms that rebuild trust and promote under - standing,52 respect, inclusion and equality can help  in navigating conflicts and impacts of displacement.  In some cases policy design and programme selec - tion that consider human and environmental rights  can be helpful in a context of contested and uncertain  futures.53 Examples include strategic impact assess - ments, regulatory impact assessments and cost-ben - efit analyses that consider both international and  local regulations, such as access to water and full citi - zenship and recognition of people who identify as les - bian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex or another  sexual minority (LGBTQI+).54 Good practices in promoting human rights point  towards identifying what binds us together and en - gaging people in dialogue about human rights in  their daily lives.55 Practices such as volunteerism and  policy mechanisms that favor inclusion and that en - hance deliberative processes can also be interpreted  184 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 as advancing insurance (spotlight 6.3) in addition to  promoting human rights. Innovation—expanding societies’  chances to thrive in uncertainty Innovation refers to mechanisms that look for new  approaches through creativity and iterative learn - ing drawing from diverse perspectives. As chapter  5 mentions, technological innovation can expand  societies’ chances for thriving in uncertainty. It is  important to prioritize investments in research and  science to push the frontiers of knowledge and mo - bilize technological change to complement, and not  replace, people. As chapter 1 highlights, it is also  fundamental to innovate responsibly, addressing justice and sustainability seeking to avoid power  concentration. Peacebuilding is one space where innovative ap - proaches are being applied to manage complexity.  Born out of new understanding of complexity and  resilience, adaptive peacebuilding prioritizes itera - tive learning to sustain peace, where peace is seen  as a continuous process rather than an end.56 Draw - ing on insights from complexity theory, the approach  recognizes that peacebuilding must respond to con - tinuously changing circumstances. The objectives for  peacebuilders then become working with communi - ties and people affected by conflict, facilitating the  creation of self-organized and resilient social institu - tions that can embrace uncertainties and channelling  nonviolent responses to stressors and shocks.57 This  is achieved through participatory decisionmaking, Box 6.3 Navigating uncertainty—the human rights anchor In a context of uncertainty, it is extremely difficult (maybe impossible) to think of ideal scenarios or optimal policies.  Even more so in a context of a plurality of views, where decisions are heavily affected by cultural context and emo - tions (chapter 3).1 Amartya Sen advocated that it is possible to make progress in assessing policy objectives without  necessarily searching for the conditions of an ideal world. The key is to identify “clearly remediable injustices.”2 Not  an easy task, either. But humanity has made remarkable progress in defining some normative principles that should  remain valid in the new context. Probably the most important consensus is encoded in the internationally agreed 1948  Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Human rights and human development are linked.3 Their concepts have a common motivation, and several human  rights can be seen as rights to capabilities. However, capabilities tend to refer to the opportunity to choose among  different alternatives for what one would like to do (opportunity freedoms), while human rights also encompass the  chance to choose freely (process freedoms).4  In times of change and deep uncertainty, human rights become even more salient to guide our collective actions  for three main reasons.  First, in a context of deep social and planetary transformations, is that they retain the focus on people.  Second is their emphasis on fundamental freedoms, which depend not only on achievements but also on the  agency of people (a dimension that has often been missing in public discussions; see chapter 3). In this space hu - man security is a subset of these fundamental freedoms (freedom from fear, from want and from indignity), explicitly  mentioned in the preamble of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Third is their universality. This defines a space of equality across all people on the planet. The 2019 Human Devel - opment Report highlights that this condition (inherited by the description of several Sustainable Development Goals)  allows the analysis of inequalities to be refocused beyond income, including on the gaps in agency and freedoms.5  The 2020 Human Development Report underscores that the lack of recognition of human rights amid dangerous  planetary change can perpetuate discrimination and injustice and makes navigation harder in the Anthropocene  context.6 The universality of human rights also ensures their validity in the expanding digital world. This is critical for protect - ing the right to participate in the cultural life of communities, the right to freedom of expression while addressing  online hate speech and disinformation, and the right to privacy.7  Notes 1. As indicated in the introduction of this chapter, in these times humans will have to serve as judge and jury for their own actions (Dasgupta  2021).  2. See discussion in Sen (2009b).  3. Sen 2005.  4. Sen 2005.  5. UNDP 2019.  6. Leach and others 2018; UNDP 2020a.  7. Bachelet 2022. CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION 185 constant iteration and variety of solutions.58 Lessons  from church-based groups, local nongovernmental  organizations and government initiatives for adaptive  peacebuilding in Rwanda point to focusing on local  needs for transitional justice. Religious institutions  facilitated spaces for Hutu, Tutsi and Twa to come  together and process their grief and honour their  loved ones after the genocide. Civil society leaders  encouraged Rwandans to take advantage of their cul - tural repertoires for healing. Through  kwihangana,59  communities achieved conflict resolution through  patience and gift giving. Local nongovernmental or - ganizations focused on tackling socioeconomic con - ditions and the mental health of women who had  faced sexual violence. The government implemented  efforts to resonate with local adaptive peacebuilding  strategies,60 teaching reconciliation in schools and  providing a space for commemoration and public  memory. Because shocks, crises and conflicts can have seri - ous effects on mental wellbeing, they should ideally  be prevented. This is not always possible, but meas - ures can be implemented to mitigate crises, and in - novations can help improve mental wellbeing—for  example, mechanisms that connect mental wellbeing  to peacebuilding or psychological resilience building  techniques.61 (See spotlight 6.4 for an elaboration of  the framework “Preventing distress, mitigating cri - ses and building resilience” introduced in figure 2.9  in chapter 2). “ Even well-  intended policies can overlook  conditions that affect the groups most likely to  be left behind. In these cases social movements  and community initiatives innovate and  experiment with alternative views, codes,  values and practices using symbols, teach-ins,  educational workshops and awareness raising Urban communities are likely to have stronger  networks due to the high density and proximity of  services, actors and resources,62 which set the con - ditions for innovative initiatives. In India it is very  common that in the name of solidarity, communities  mobilize to establish small-scale decentralized com - posting plants. The Residents’ Initiative for a Safe  Environment started in Bengaluru with 1,200 house - holds coordinating waste separation and collection at composting sites. The initiative depended on engag - ing many households without external support and  on their willingness to contribute financially.63 Innovation requires creative energy to address  complex problems through community interactions.64  Dangerous planetary change and new threats are  pushing some countries to transition to clean energy  systems. In India one of the challenges of distributing  energy is rural areas, so the country has introduced  the National Solar Mission, with mechanisms to en - courage community-based off-grid projects.65 Two  initiatives based in the provinces of Rajasthan and  Uttar Pradesh have attempted different solutions to  bring electricity to their communities. Innovative organized actions can strengthen the  individual and community repertoires and power, in - fluence decisionmakers and transform traditional so - cial norms and cultural behaviours. Community involvement can also ensure that pol - icies reflect people’s priorities. Even well-  intended  policies can overlook conditions that affect the  groups most likely to be left behind. In these cases so - cial movements and community initiatives innovate  and experiment with alternative views, codes, values  and practices66 using symbols, teach-ins, educational  workshops and awareness raising.67 In Israel a wel - fare-to-work programme was implemented to benefit  the long-term unemployed, requiring all adults from  beneficiary households to participate full time. But  the programme did not account for the needs of those  dependent on unpaid care work. A local group of men  and women in one of the areas that lack day-care fa - cilities started advocating for their right to participate  in the labour market and to have access to care. The  group organized a participatory needs assessment to  express the needs of the community.68 This example  aligns with inclusive localism, focused on empow - ering and investing in the capabilities and agency of  local communities.69 Innovation can also result from recombination or  iteration.70 Initiatives such as Thinking and Working  Politically and Problem-Driven Iterative Adaptation  have an advantage when the problem is complex, the  context is novel or the solutions are contentious.71 For  instance, the organization Funda Wande was created  based on the fact that 58 percent of children in South  Africa were unable to read for meaning in any lan - guage at the end of grade 4.72 The organization aimed  186 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 to improve children’s reading skills. Using the itera - tive adaptation approach73 to deconstruct the prob - lem, it identified four main causes: weak institutional  functionality, undue union influence, weak teacher  content and pedagogical skills, and wasted learning  time. “ Another area that requires innovation  is tackling misinformation. Major social  media platforms have enacted policies  such as notices, warnings and links  to resources on misinformation Local actors, native language speakers, teachers  and other relevant stakeholders were brought in for  another diagnosis, which identified teacher train - ing and reading materials as action entry points. In  Eastern Cape and Limpopo, two of the worst per - forming provinces, iterating and revising practices  led to teaching materials being produced in local lan - guages, thereby adapting them to each setting. Only  a cheaper set of materials in native languages would  accomplish widespread readership. The organization  currently runs its programme in 30 schools in Eastern  Cape, 80 schools in Limpopo and 50 schools in West - ern Cape.74 Another area that requires innovation is tackling  misinformation. Social media have transformed the  methods, speed and scale of spreading misinforma - tion, especially where it is organized and intention - al (spotlight 6.5). Major social media platforms have  enacted policies such as notices, warnings and links  to resources on misinformation. For example, links  to official information by the World Health Organi - zation are suggested under posts mentioning Covid- 19 on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.  And Twitter alerts users who share an article without  opening the link first. At the same time fact-checking  initiatives have been created by users of these plat - forms, and media plurality has been strengthened  through new and independent outlets that could not  exist or have the means to inform in the tradition - al media landscape, often at the local and grassroot  levels. Innovation is also important when it comes to new  ways of measuring human development (box 6.4).  Motivated scientists can fulfil a social role75—for ex - ample, in contributing to green transitions through advocating for taxes on pollution.76 Committed re - searchers and scientists who let their values guide  their work are a powerful force, as they can draw so - ciety’s attention to the perils of climate change77 or  other development challenges. In this sense there  is also a need to expand the research and measure - ment of social norms (perceptions and values),78 as  understanding them is also key to socially coordinat - ing people.79 Beyond data collection, research is de - veloping models to predict social norm change and  methodological tools to test the causal effect of social  norms.80 Drawing from cultural change For investment, insurance and innovation strategies  to promote agency and advance human develop - ment, opportunities for common deliberation to ac - company cultural change are important (figure  6.3).  Building a solid institutional capacity open to di - versity and deliberation can be seen as insurance in  uncertain times. Under uncertainty, mismatches be - tween current and needed institutions can emerge.81  Strengthening intergroup contact82 can reduce hos - tilities against other parties and provide opportuni - ties for common deliberation that fosters cultural  change.83 Education, social recognition and representation84  are some of the ways stakeholders can encourage cul - tural change supportive of investment, insurance and  innovation.85 Education to cultivate evolving values Education—a powerful tool to instil reasoning and  critical thinking, opening possibilities for new values  and attitudes in younger generations—is key for agen - cy. It can encourage people to act regarding climate  change and other Anthropocene pressures, providing  them with ownership and agency to shape their own  future and hold decisionmakers to account.86 Govern - ments and other organizations have explored myriad  education curricula to shape the next generations’  wellbeing. One is comprehensive sexuality educa - tion,87 an approach that schools around the world are  implementing to improve sexual reproductive health,  prevent dating violence and increase understanding  CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION 187 Box 6.4 Augmenting the resolution of the Human Development Index values using satellite imagery and artificial  intelligence Data collection to measure human development is challenging. It is difficult to get accurate and high-quality informa - tion for some regions across the globe. In this context remote technology and satellite imagery can help researchers  and decisionmakers observe, explore and evaluate the status of human development1 in a timely, consistent and  affordable way2 and can fill gaps in official statistics.3 The availability of geolocalized and satellite imagery data can inform decisionmakers of where to implement  policies, who to target and how to allocate resources efficiently.4 For example, targeted policies or programmes that  require monitoring Human Development Index (HDI) values at the local level. The United Nations Development Pro - gramme (UNDP) estimates HDI values at the national level based on country-level data, but some countries produce  subnational estimates. There have been prior efforts to measure HDI values locally, producing a snapshot at the state  or province level using survey and administrative data,5 but these remain spatially coarse and expensive to produce.  A recent collaboration between UNDP and academic researchers uses daytime and night-time satellite imagery  to estimate HDI values at highly disaggregated geographic resolution (box figure 1).6 Using a machine-learning  technique, it is possible to train an artificial intelligence algorithm that associates image elements with HDI values,  employing these image elements to estimate HDI values at the local scale.  Box figure 1 Estimates of Human Development Index values at the state or province and county levels in  selected countries of Africa, the Middle East and Latin America Estimates at the state or province level Estimates at the county level HDI 0.800 0.600 0.400 Source:  Based on Sherman and others (2022) and Smits and Permanyer (2019). Maps from https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/maps/ . These results are experimental since there are no official local HDI values to fully validate these estimates. Never- theless, new measurement tools are promising and have great potential to be scaled up, with appropriate bench - marking and data calibration.7 Combining satellite imagery and machine learning is an exciting direction for future  research to expand how the HDI is used for decisionmaking.

The curriculum has contributed to the normalization  of same-sex romantic relationships and the reduction  of homophobia and homophobic bullying and har - assment in schools. It has also led to shifting norms  around intimate partner violence, leading to the re - duction of such cases as a result.88 Discussions of the role of education for change in  social norms envisage schools as a space that em - bodies inclusion and diversity. Teaching practices  also affect students’ beliefs and trust in institutions.  Education not only dictates the content of students’  learning—the what—but also the how and with  whom. The how relates to teaching practices that  have an impact on student beliefs and world views. In  some cases educational attainment shapes one’s be - liefs. Across countries women with higher education - al attainment are less likely to believe that husbands  are justified in beating their wives if they argue.89 In  addition, research sheds light on how different teach - ing styles have divergent impacts on students’ values.  Students who are taught with horizontal teaching  practices that entail working in groups on projects are  more likely to participate in civic life, believe in coop - eration with others and tolerate different ideas.90 The question of with whom students receive educa - tion is equally critical. Education that provides space for students of various backgrounds contributes to  norm changes, especially tolerance for differences and  diversity.91 For example, students can understand by  their lived experiences that gender does not determine  one’s ability to learn or perform. Teachers’ attitudes to - wards female students also affect how students view  equality among the sexes. In India, when the govern - ment of Delhi made a policy to provide at least 20 per - cent of the seating in elite schools to students from  low-income households, students with high economic  status were more understanding and had less discrim - inatory views against the poor students.92 Hence, regu - lar personal interactions enabled by the inclusion and  diversity policy in education destigmatized economi - cally marginalized individuals. By the same token, efforts to prevent violent ex - tremism through education aim to use education to  create a space for inclusion and a sense of belonging  for young people at risk of joining violent extremist  groups. Here, education serves as an alternative for  such young people, as one underlying driver to join  violent extremist groups appears to be feeling exclud - ed and marginalized in the community and seeking a  sense of belonging in militia groups.93 Education also  provides new knowledge and fosters critical think - ing to strengthen students’ resilience and prevent  them from subscribing to extremist ideologies when Figure 6.3 Accompanying cultural changes with education, recognition and representation Educational curricula Schools embodying diversity  Horizontal teaching practices  Build teachers’ capacity Prevent violent extremismsIncrease diversity  in public spaces Transitional justice Support social movementsEqual participation in  decisionmakingHuman rights laws Change scripts and narratives Media campaigns to prevent discrimination Reduce mental health stigma Education RepresentationRecognition Accompany cultural changes Source: Human Development Report Office based on Lamont (forthcoming). CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION 189 exposed to them. It can thus be a catalyst for norm  change and an instrument that empowers students to  shape new norms and culture. Recognition to enhance legitimacy Social recognition can be accomplished through  changes in laws and regulations to recognize human  rights, media campaigns to raise awareness or chang - es in policy narratives to recognize the interest of  right holders and respect for their identities and val - ues. Take policies on recognizing same-sex relation - ships. A recent study using data from the European  Social Surveys evaluated the change in narratives and  attitudes towards different sexual orientations in Eu - rope after 17 countries legalized same-sex marriage  and 11 legalized same-sex civil unions. Individuals  living in countries with legal recognition of same-sex  relationships showed more positive attitudes towards  LGBT people. These results are consistent with legit - imacy models, where legal recognition legitimates a  group in society and attitudes towards the group ad - just as a result.94 “ Social recognition can help change  scripts and narratives to portray groups in  different ways and build hope in society Social recognition can help change scripts and nar - ratives to portray groups in different ways and build  hope in society. Climate change activism among in - digenous young people in New Zealand has faced  multiple challenges to transforming narratives, such  as anthropocentrism, racism, adultism or generic  recommendations to fight planetary change. Never - theless, through activism and changes in education  Māori youth narratives based on stories of coloni - zation and indigenous systems of values and beliefs  have had a ripple effect, enabling children and young  people to feel a sense of hope and empowerment.95  “Governance of climate and natural resources emerg - es best when rooted in stories about human purpose,  identity, duty and responsibility.”96 Nondiscrimination mechanisms can enhance an  individual’s ability to choose. These include prevent - ing those most likely to be left behind from being  discriminated against in access to resources such as health, education, land, natural resources, and labour  and financial markets. Media campaigns to prevent  discrimination, reduce stigma or promote narratives  that influence power balance are examples. Con - sider the high rates of violence against women and  girls in East Africa. A recent innovation randomly  implemented a media campaign across 112 villages,  reaching more than 10,000 citizens. Results from in - terviews several months after the experiment showed  an increase in the willingness to report violence  against women and girls to the authorities.97 Media campaigns can also reduce discrimination  and stigma, contribute to equal access to resources  and increase freedoms and agency. In Bangladesh  a popular animated television programme, Meena,  portrayed a nine-year-old female lead who dreamed  of learning and discovered her math and writing  skills through the episodes. The programme reduced  the cultural and religious stigma of girls going to  school in rural areas and increased their attendance.98  It focused on describing how religious and cultural  practices can generate discrimination and affect girls’  lives and health. By influencing beliefs around girls  accessing education, the narratives could balance  power and change social norms. More attention is needed as well to dismantle stig - matization of mental health, which can be achieved by  changing social norms and narratives.99 In Ghana and  Kenya the Time to Change Global campaign tackled  stigma and discrimination against mental health, dis - seminating on social media videos of real experiences  with stigma and myths about mental health. Accord - ing to an evaluation, there was a significant positive  impact: in Ghana the desire to socially distance from  people with mental health challenges was reduced,  and in Kenya knowledge of mental health increased.100  Narratives can thus work as lenses that allow people  to look at mental health from a different perspective. Representation to advance inclusiveness Finally, representation, power and voice can foster  people’s ability to influence and participate while  encouraging others. Increasing the representa - tion, power and voice of diverse experiences in  public spaces, institutions, governance processes,  leadership positions, art, film, photography, music  190 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 and writing can shape the definitions of who mat - ters, foster their agency and encourage other people  to participate. Recent research to explore the impact  of women’s representation in Cameroon’s parliament  found that their presence increases their participa - tion in decisionmaking structures and influences the  topics the parliament debates.101 Considering intergenerational relationships can  also point out mechanisms related to reparations,  reconciliation and transitional justice.102 Australia’s  parliament issued an official acknowledgment and  apology to the Stolen Generations103 and their fami - lies and a report outlining recommendations to sup - port reconciliation.104 The Community Arts Network  started a program to amplify the voices of indigenous  elders to tell their stories of oppression, suffering and  survival. The common elements in their narratives  were cycles of dispossession, consequences of dis - possession in their lives, and cultural continuity and  survival. Through spaces of representation the in - digenous elders gave voice to their history as part of  healing, and the wider community was asked to ac - knowledge the stories and legacy to understand the  land they inhabit.105 Participating in decisionmaking and building so - cial networks are key to strengthen representation  and agency. Inclusion is essential for devolving de - cisionmaking power to local contexts, through which  equal participation and cooperation at the communi - ty level can be achieved.106 In Kutna Hora, Czechia,  the government conducted participatory budgeting  with young people and children in 2019. Both prima - ry and high school students participated in the local  government’s budget allocation. Each class appoint - ed representatives to present a project on behalf of  their schools for the budget from the school level up  to the municipal level. Young people filled the role  of coordinators in the local rounds of budget allo - cations. In the final phase the budget allocation was  opened for all the students to vote. The initial idea  from the local government was for young people to experience democracy on their own as executers and  decisionmakers. In contrast with similar exercises,  this case was motivated by the objective of incorpo - rating young people.107 Collective action and social movements  shaping culture and coping with uncertainty Collective action, through social movements and  community-level initiatives, can be a source of inspi - ration for researchers, policymakers and advocates  (spotlights 6.6 and 6.7). To redress inequalities and provide equal oppor - tunities for people to expand their agency and foster  human development, transformation is imperative  at the level of social norms and culture. Social move - ments are key to achieving that. Where we go from here is our choice We must learn to live with uncertain times and unset - tled lives. This year’s Human Development Report  challenges us to aspire to more than mere accommo - dation. Unlocking our human potential will require  us to let flexibility, creativity, solidarity and inclusion  guide us to imagine and create futures in which we  thrive. Where we go from here is our choice. One of the  great lessons of our species’ history is that we can ac - complish a lot with very little if we work in solidarity  towards shared goals. Dangerous planetary change,  uncharted transitions and polarization are making  uncertainty more challenging. Even so, we have more  tools than ever to help navigate and course correct,  and no amount of technological wizardry is a substi - tute for good leadership, social cohesion or trust. If  we can start fixing the human side of the planetary  ledger—and this Report tries to highlight how—then  the future, however uncertain, will be more promise  than peril, just as it should be. CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION 191 Flexibility should be understood as rejecting one- size-fits-all policy solutions and deliberately prac - ticing iteration, variation and recombination in  policymaking. For instance, chapter 4 builds on the  need to upgrade strategies for human security such  as strengthening social protection systems with built- in adaptive capabilities. Practices such as feedback  loops, iterative learning and iterative design can be  valuable tools to navigate uncertain contexts and find  solutions that adapt best to different contexts and  moments. A key factor for creating knowledge and transmit - ting ideas is cumulative cultural evolution.1 Because  evolution does not necessarily mean efficiency and  equality of outcomes, it requires strategies to favour  flexibility, allowing adaptation to constantly chang - ing conditions. But efficiency and flexibility need not  be interchangeable in policy outcomes if flexibility is  based on dynamic mechanisms to enable change.2 In  fact, a balance of both can be superior in uncertain  contexts.3 Creativity would have a hard time thriving in ho - mogeneous and rigid contexts, and adequate con - text-aware solutions are hard to find through safe  repetition of a narrow set of policies. In chapter 3 suc - cessful policy reformers were characterized by their  willingness to try creative problem-solving strategies.  Uncertainty means we are always facing new and  multifaceted challenges. Solutions to these challeng - es can emerge only in environments with matching  dynamism. Chapter 5 points out how our ability to  thrive under uncertainty and achieve transformations  will depend on creative policy change. In practice,  creativity requires exploring tools and approaches  such as iterative learning, diverse perspectives and  risk management. Creativity depends on societies’  interconnectedness, the fidelity of the information  and learning transmitted, and cultural trait diversity.4 Solidarity should be understood as recognizing our  interconnectedness. “Solidarity does not assume that our struggles are the same struggles, or that our pain  is the same pain, or that our hope is for the same fu - ture. Solidarity involves commitment, and work, as  well as the recognition that even if we do not have  the same feelings, or the same lives, or the same bod - ies, we do live in common ground.”5 For example, re - distributive policies such as robust social protection  recognize how inequities in agency, freedoms and ca - pabilities have direct and indirect consequences for  all individuals, groups and societies.  Incorporating solidarity means acknowledging that  our lives are interconnected by the multidimensional  impacts of our choices and our shared physical, eco - nomic and social spaces. In the face of uncertainty,  people can turn to default values that go beyond stra - tegic thinking, and in an environment of trust, the de - fault can be solidarity (chapter 4). And transitions to  renewable energy can be done in solidarity with the  groups and places where the resources reside (chap - ter 1), while unsustainable arrangements could pre - vent the consolidation of human development gains  for everyone. Inclusion can enable transformations, as seen in  examples throughout the Report. Chapter 4 high - lights ensuring access and equity in communications  technology. Chapters 2 and 5 discuss regulating arti - ficial intelligence to address algorithmic bias and dis - crimination. Inclusiveness goes beyond increasing  participation and diversity; it requires shifts in insti - tutions’ norms and attitudes and the cooperation of  relevant stakeholders, society and policymakers to  address the roots of unequal treatment.6 These four motivating principles are nonexhaus - tive, but balancing them could help chart paths to  transformation. Driving transformation requires ac - knowledging the links and tensions between them.  These principles are not mutually exclusive. They  often coexist and enable each other. For instance,  inclusion can unlock innovation.7 Exposure to diver - sity (of people, practices and institutions)8 motivates SPOTLIGHT 6.1 Principles to be cultivated to navigate uncertainty 192 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 people to learn,9 and iterative learning is part of  innovation.10 Solidarity and inclusion11 are interdependent. Sol - idarity requires recognizing and incorporating the  diversity of individuals, groups, perspectives and  lived experiences that coexist. At the same time  greater inclusion contributes to solidarity by fight - ing divisiveness and inequalities. Social movements  can teach us a lot about solidarity in the search for  inclusion, leading the way to leave no one behind.  Institutions can support the transformations pushed  by social movements and community initiatives by  listening to the diverse voices of those whose rights  are being abridged, allocating resources and inform - ing their research agendas to complement collective  actions.12 Beyond the multiple intersections there also might  be some tensions between these motivating princi - ples. The paradox of diversity represents an example, as chapter 3 discusses.13 Cultural trait diversity has  perhaps the largest potential to empower creativity  because it increases the recombinatorial possibilities.  But it also increases coordination costs due to the  multitude of perspectives. To address this, the cul - tural evolution approach analyses how high cultural  trait diversity allows for an evolution of approaches  favouring the traits that best adapt to the current cir - cumstances,14 understanding that these traits might  fall out of favour if the circumstances change. This re - quires a high tolerance for diversity, but it also means  that there will be inequality of outcomes because  some approaches borne out of the recombination  might fail and be discarded. However, the success - ful ones will spread and benefit all.15 So, although it  is generally possible to align flexibility, creativity, sol - idarity and inclusion, there is not a straightforward  path for them to work together, and tensions might  mean compromises along the way.

Women have organized initiatives  that range from local saving clubs and cooperatives to  traditional craft and barter systems.1 For the Zamuk - phila Women’s Community Project, women in Upsh - er villages formed a vegetable-growing community,  growing 70 percent to sell on the roadsides and the  rest for self-consumption. The project received sup - port from a corporation that allocated a piece of irri - gated land adjacent to the village, while the women  provided fertilizer and seeds.2 Another project in South Africa—the Mansomani  initiative, led by Black women—mobilized communi - ty support to convert a piece of land into an irrigated  sugar cane field and liaise with a local sugar mill. This  helped secure a source of income for community pro - ducers. Key success factors were leadership, which  persisted for more than 20 years, and external sup - port. In this line, external agents, such as nongovern - mental organizations, or governments can support  initiatives sensitive to local needs and aspirations,  preserving the community’s agency.3 Through this project women used what was already in place—land  and irrigation—and invested in crop resources to have  more economic independence and be better pre - pared to face shocks. In 2012 a group of practitioners in Democratic Re - public of the Congo started the African Institute for  Integrated Responses to Violence Against Women  and HIVAIDS at the Panzi Hospital to research men - tal health in African contexts. The hospital partnered  with a local feminist organization to provide counsel - ling and training in Kiswahili. Capacity building of  medical staff along with individual and group coun - selling sessions using music and dance to facilitate  healing and livelihood therapy provided for land and  tools for women to restart farming or rebuild assets.4  Building women’s emotional and economic agen - cy translated into more inclusion in political spaces,  empowering the women to express solidarity by or - ganizing themselves to raise funds by selling local  products.5 Having the perspective of local women af - fected by the same structural inequalities facilitated  coordination and communication and opened a dif - ferent array of possible solutions. NOTES 1 Nel and Binns 2000. 2 Nel and Binns 2000. 3 Nel and Binns 2000.4 Allowing women who are experiencing distress, stigmatization and isola - tion to embody positive states of spiritual and social connection can help  them heal as they find feelings of connection and belonging in collective  voice, movement and creative self-expression (Horn 2020). 5 Horn 2020.SPOTLIGHT 6.2 How local communities confront  rapid environmental change 194 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 Volunteerism can be seen as collective insurance  rooted in solidarity that can prepare communities for  environmental shocks. In Sudan during seasons of  either high demand or drought, communities work  together through nafeer  (calls to mobilize), where  people help each other plant and harvest crops. The  military engages as well, protecting the harvests from  theft and reconstructing mosques and other buildings  damaged during conflict. Without trust, collabora - tion and communication to build a sense of solidari - ty, this activity could not be accomplished by just one  farmer. But when people come together, crops can be  harvested faster and more productively.1 Policy mechanisms that favour inclusion typically  remove barriers or discriminatory attitudes and be - haviours to ensure people’s participation in social,  economic, political and civic spheres.2 Equal partici - pation fosters agency and increases diversity through  opportunities and choice. Inclusion can work as in - surance. For example, including smallholder farmers  in the design, business models and decisionmaking  of digital platform providers would go a long way  towards enabling the full potential and benefits of  information and communications technology innova - tions in Africa.3 There is rising demand for inclusion  policies as women, indigenous peoples and migrants  continue to be excluded.4 Since 2017 the Colombian  government has provided a special permit to grant  Venezuelan immigrants permission to work. In gener - al, the programme has expanded access to the labour  market, but barriers such as recognition of creden - tials or access to financial markets persist, limiting  the opportunities for immigrant workers.5 As part of a set of flexible and inclusive assessment methods, the  Netherlands has been working with local migrant and  refugee organizations to offer proof of Dutch-equiva - lent credentials and facilitate the assessment and rec - ognition of Syrian nationals’ qualifications.6 Deliberation can serve as insurance for polariza - tion7 and is one of the keys to achieving recognition.8  Although a natural human capacity, deliberation re - quires intentional and concerted efforts: rules, to  prompt inclusive and civil deliberation; stories that  make sense, provide meaning and instil a collective  sense of commitment; leadership that engages citi - zens in a deliberative rhetoric; outcomes that matter  to people; and the possibility to pass on and learn the  skills to instil a culture of deliberation.9 Deliberation  is especially important for enabling public reason - ing in a participatory and inclusive way, where ideas  are represented and put forth by all groups irrespec - tive of their political, economic or other status (see  chapter 4). Even in the absence of organized deliber - ation, contact among groups has been shown to de - crease dehumanization across groups10 and reduce  hostility.11 However, negative contact can exacerbate  hostilities,12 pointing to the importance of setting  up deliberation and intergroup contact for success  through the conditions and settings in which they  are encouraged. Beyond deliberation, voting is effec - tive as well because it allows citizens to restrain de - fectors and reassures cooperative citizens that their  efforts are not futile. Accompanying cultural change  could consist of a shift in the mindset from exclusive - ly seeking self-interest to believing that people can  make decisions for the greater good.13 NOTES 1 Lough and others 2018. 2 Yang and others 2016. 3 Sarku 2022. 4 Yang and others 2016. 5 Selee and Bolter 2022. 6 Desiderio 2016. 7 Fishkin and others 2021.8 Fuentes-Nieva 2022. 9 Ryfe 2005. 10 Bruneau and others 2021. 11 Wojcieszak and Warner 2020. 12 Wojcieszak and Warner 2020. 13 Hauser and others 2014.SPOTLIGHT 6.3 How volunteerism, inclusion and  deliberation can work as insurance 195 CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION Mental distress can become an obstacle to human  development under certain circumstances (see chap - ter 2). To avoid this, policymakers as well as people  themselves can take action and prevent situations that  cause mental distress, mitigate crises and build psy - chological resilience without leaving anyone behind. Preventing distress The first layer of policies to tackle the cycle of distress  and constrained human development consists of pre - venting distress. Building safe environments through  strong national institutions and international cooper - ation is the ideal setting. Socioeconomic policymak - ing can contribute to this goal. Income support, for  instance, has been shown to significantly decrease  mental distress of children and young people living  in a household.1 Education is key to empowerment,  enabling people to filter good-quality information  out of abundant information during the digital age.  It can also encourage people to take action regarding  climate change and other anthropogenic pressures,  proving them with ownership and agency to shape  their own future.2 And it can prevent discrimination.3 Diplomacy and negotiation can prevent some vi - olent conflicts. But other conflicts can be stopped  from turning violent at a much earlier stage through  socially cohesive communities as well as tightly knit  support networks.4 Moreover, social embeddedness   — social connections and interpersonal relationships  within social networks and group identities  — has  been found to reduce stress and anxiety.5 In the face  of threat and uncertainty, cultural norms are crucial  to keep societies cohesive and organized.6 Mitigating crises As demonstrated by the Covid-19 pandemic, as well  as by multiple extreme weather events around the globe, crisis prevention may not always be possible in  the light of unprecedented threats. In that case socio - economic policies can provide transitionary continu - ity and stability. During multiple lockdowns caused  by the pandemic, economies with strong social con - tracts and robust social protection schemes caused  fewer worries to the people and were less affected by  economic consequences.7 Examples include univer - sal emergency payments comparable to a temporary  universal basic income8 and some traditional social  protection policies such as extended sickness bene - fits, unemployment protection and benefits for fam - ilies and older people.9 The pandemic has shown that  strong social institutions can help mitigate crises by  contributing to stability. But some of these measures  can also help during extreme weather events, when  droughts or floods impair harvests, or when liveli - hoods are damaged during armed conflicts. Relying  on tightly knit social protection schemes assures peo - ple’s livelihoods and can thus alleviate mental dis - tress until crises are overcome. Building resilience Not all uncertainties and crises can be prevented or  mitigated, but this does not mean that people have  to develop mental disorders. With universal access  to mental health services as well as other culturally  aligned resilience building and healing approaches,10  people are often able to absorb mental distress and  thrive in the context of uncertainties. Many of these  services could be offered within existing social struc - tures, such as schools and community centres. There is a wide variety of mental health and well - being interventions, but some have proven especial - ly effective for distress. For example, eye movement  desensitization and reprocessing has shown signifi - cant improvement of post-traumatic stress disorder  symptoms,11 including in veterans and children,12  exceeding the success of pharmacotherapy.13 Yoga SPOTLIGHT 6.4 Addressing mental distress:  Capabilities for people and policymakers 196 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 can alleviate anxiety, depression and somatization14  and release stress-related muscle tensions that can  cause migraines.15 Mindfulness exercises and med - itation have been used in psychotherapy for a long  time,16 and empirical evidence shows that they can  improve depression17 and aggressive behaviour.18  Accessible at large scale, this can break cycles of  violence and mental distress  — one step towards building peaceful societies. More attention needs to  be paid to providing universal access to these and  other techniques as well as to dismantling stigma - tization around mental health. Narratives within  the policy discourse can help achieve this and foster  hope collectively.19 Source: Human Development Report Office.

People  can now immediately find and share content with bil - lions of other users online through platforms such as  Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, Snapchat,  TikTok, Twitter, WhatsApp and YouTube, among  many others. Publicity, the arts, entertainment, com - merce, advocacy, education, journalism and even  public entities have adapted strategies to reach users  in online socialization spaces. The same applies to  the distribution of news. By 2021 close to 60 percent  of users in some world regions were using platforms  such as Facebook and WhatsApp to get their news  (figure S6.5.1).1  Along with the potential benefits of rapidly ex - panding virtual social spaces, social media provide  fertile ground for spreading misinformation2 and  fake news,3 and the targeted and intentional use of  platforms to enhance polarization and radicaliza - tion.4 Prominent social media platforms have been  called to action on this front by users, policymakers,  authorities and their own conviction.  The policy discussion on misinformation often  finds tension in the intersection between freedom of  expression and both the importance of accurate, veri - fied and trustworthy diffusion of information and the  determination of boundaries of respect and civility  in online behaviour. “We want to help people stay in - formed without stifling productive public discourse. There is also a fine line between false news and sat - ire or opinion.”5 “It’s not just what we take down, but  how we treat all the content we leave up that gives us  the best path forward. (…) An overly aggressive ap - proach towards removals would also have a chilling  effect on free speech.”6 Big social media platforms  now have policies and guidelines on misinformation  and have developed varying strategies to combat it,  ranging from user-initiated reporting features to re - moval of misinformation and restriction of accounts.  Governing bodies, national and international, have  shown more interest in the effects of media misinfor - mation. The UN Secretary-General’s Roadmap for  Digital Cooperation and the upcoming Global Dig - ital Compact in the context of the Common Agenda  incorporate prioritizing digital trust and security for  the present and future of digital development.7 Poli - cy recommendations on misinformation at the inter - national level highlight the importance of protecting  human rights and freedom of expression; emphasiz - ing methods that build trust, media literacy and co - operation; and emphasizing the dangers of overusing  and misusing censorship.8 The European Union has increased its regulation  on disinformation and the use of social media. The  European Commission developed an action plan  that includes a Code of Practice on Disinformation,  the European Digital Media Observatory and the Eu - ropean Democracy Action Plan, with guidelines for  Figure S6.5.1 A considerable portion of users across the world get their news from social media platforms 4591114162340 TelegramTikTokTwitterFB MessengerInstagramWhatsAppYouTubeFacebookEurope 2611131062534North America 99141118244243Asia 611161128353557Latin America 1814341529554459Africa Source: Newman and others 2022.SPOTLIGHT 6.5 Social media misinformation and freedom of expression 198 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 obligations and accountability of online platforms.9  The Digital Services Act, a “comprehensive set of  new rules regulating the responsibilities of digital ser - vices that act as intermediaries within the EU to con - nect consumers with goods, services and content,”10 was agreed in April 2022 and will reshape the obliga - tions and relationships between digital services and  governance structures in Europe.

This can translate  into collective organization and action in search of  community resilience and better development out - comes. Social movements are a clear example of how  people’s choices have supported transformations.  Throughout history the world has witnessed the  power of social movements, where people connected  by a shared purpose or common identity have trig - gered transformational change for entire societies.3  A wide range of social movements develop because  of unmet expectations and moral beliefs of fairness  and social justice.4 Some do so through collective  identity.5 In all cases the process is linked to emotions  and cultural ideas with the power to transform a per - sonal goal or interest, to adopt the goals and interests  of a group.6 Individuals involving themselves in a so - cial movement develop a shared normative perspec - tive or shared concerns for change that give them a  sense of common purpose.7 Individuals join social movements and sustain  their mobilization because of rational, emotional, be - havioural, leadership, organizational and social-nor - mative factors.8 Even though emotions are present  in every phase of the lifecycle of a social movement9  and they positively motivate individuals, they have  often been dismissed or unjustly judged by outsid - ers.10 For instance, protestors are often portrayed as  irrational or immature,11 hostile or violent, or as need - ing to be disciplined.12 The study of emotions in pol - itics and social movements emerged to recognize  that emotions permeate any political action,13 shape  movements’ goals and determine their success. This analysis can provide insights to necessary changes for  transformation by encouraging new ways of thinking  and approaching policy mechanisms.  For a social movement to succeed, one of the  most important factors is for it to lead towards so - cial change and transformation as well as strategic  choices.14 Social movements can emerge when a large  group of people become distressed by a particular  situation or driven by leaders who mobilize people  and facilitate broader awareness of concerns, then  coalesce when they become more organized to raise  awareness and mobilize resources. After formal and  informal institutions take notice of a movement and  bureaucratize it, a social movement can follow sever - al paths before starting to decline (figure S6.6.1).15 Successful social movements have demonstrated  a commitment to changing norms and attitudes, not  just policy reforms. For instance, LGBTQI+ advo - cates used polling research to reframe public cam - paign messages on rights to include wording on love  and commitment as well; this eventually turned into  the “Love is love” slogan and contributed to change  in marriage laws.16 The frequency of social protests increased by an av - erage of 11.5 percent a year between 2009 and 2019  across all regions of the world, with the largest con - centration of activity in the Middle East and North  Africa and the fastest growth in Sub-Saharan Africa.17  The Covid-19 pandemic halted mass protests from  March to May 2020, but rather than disappearing, so - cial movements adapted to the pandemic measures  and bounced back as restrictions eased.18  Identity social movements arise to challenge tra - ditional understandings of power distribution and  reframe how certain groups are perceived. These  movements aim to reclaim and transform narratives  around identity for a group that has been historical - ly discriminated against and oppressed. Confront - ing traditional beliefs and behaviours constitutes  a reclaim of power and provides a sense of agency, SPOTLIGHT 6.6 Collective action and social movements   shaping culture and coping with uncertainty 200 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 pride, self-confidence and equality.19 This type of  movement is both reformative and transformative,  as it looks to expand opportunities but also freedoms.  Take the example of the feminist movement (spot - light 6.7). Although powerful in their transformative capacity  and as examples of in-group solidarity, identity-based  struggles may also reify adversarial narratives be - tween groups and reaffirm structural and social divi - sions based on certain identity dimensions. This can  bring about challenges in broader global cooperation  and can lead to violence and conflict. It can also over - shadow the freedom that exists within self-identifica - tion and the overlapping multidimensional identities  across the world. This is especially concerning for  movements that seek to encroach on the freedoms  of others. As argued in chapter 3, key to address - ing these challenges is recognizing that each person  comprises multiple, overlapping identities that can  acquire different salience depending on context and  can change over time. Social movements’ enduring impacts permeate  cultural repertoires and transform societies. They  can change the way we live, make us question tra - ditional beliefs, reposition identities and eliminate stereotypes and prejudices. The policy changes that  have emerged from protests and movements have de - pended on broad changes in public attitudes.20 Mobi - lizations change culture through different channels:  public opinion, memories, language and lifestyle, the  media, and political and nonpolitical institutions.21  They are a way to give momentum and directionali - ty to the feedback cycle between social attitudes and  norms and institutional and policy responses. The nature and tone of media coverage can shift  public opinion perceptions, even if indirectly. A study  documenting public opinion change as an outcome  of the feminist movement in the United States ar - gues that the media coverage had a significant effect  on gender attitudes, such that the public started re - considering traditional roles and adopting alterna - tive views.22 Although traditional news outlets still  dominate news gathering in Europe and the United  States23 and have a strong influence over politics, so - cial media has impacted these dynamics significant - ly in recent years as the circulation of news stories is  increasingly featured on platforms such as Facebook,  Instagram, TikTok, Twitter and YouTube. Through  media and social media, activists have defied tra - ditional portrayals of groups, combated stigma and Figure S6.6.1 Social movements connect collective action with institutions Emerge Bureaucratize DeclineRaise awareness  and mobilize resources Success Failure Repression MainstreamingCo-optation Coalesce Link to media  and institutions Source: Human Development Report Office elaboration adapted from Blumer (1995), Mauss (1975) and Tilly (1977). 201 CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION increased the representation of groups among writ - ers, producers and performers.24 More decentralized  and open access to media has increased the rep - resentation and diversity of perspectives on a plat - form. But it has also raised concerns about the quality  of information and the need for tools to filter, discern  and manage violence, hate and misinformation. In  these contexts there is a risk for some forms of social  movements to spread misinformation and promote  forms of injustice, domination and oppression.  Changes in day-to-day behaviours, such as life - style or language, are other channels for movements  to trigger change. The changes in the law for same- sex marriage has triggered rapid shifts in attitudes.  Combined with the activism of LGBTQI+ rights  movement, the changes have combatted stigma, re - framed gender as a social construct and incorporat - ed inclusive language and gender-neutral pronouns  for nonbinary and queer people.25 However, in some  countries where third-gender categories have been  officially recognized for decades, many LGBTQI+  activists are campaigning against the forceful impo - sition of third-gender pronouns, highlighting the im - portance of people having the agency to determine  their own identity rather than having it imposed  on them by outside actors.26 Thanks to the feminist  movement the terms machismo or male chauvinist,  feminist and sexist have become more widely used  and understood.27Other movements such as those linked to environ - mentalism and social justice have produced lifestyle  changes in societies where they are most promi - nent.28 People modify their behaviour to be coherent  across their ideologies, values and actions. Exam - ples of changes in daily behaviours include boycott - ing firms that do not comply with raised standards  for sustainable behaviour. These conscious consum - ers are more likely to become politically active29 and  can present incentives for businesses to increasing - ly declare and act on their social and environmental  principles with more inclusive and sustainable prac - tices.30 Local communities are transforming practic - es for sustainable food systems as well. Indigenous  communities have learned how to live off the earth  without damaging the integrity of ecosystems. Māori  and Quechua communities have built a platform to  reclaim cultural rights over food landscapes by pro - moting collective rights and responsibilities over land  and food, based on their community practices to pre - serve agrobiodiversity.31 When individuals belonging to a community per - ceive that government institutions or authorities are  unreliable and unsupportive, policies and regula - tion might seem insufficient. This creates a need for  action, and collaboration is used as a coping mech - anism.32 In these contexts social movements are  rooted in solidarity, key for overcoming injustice,  domination and oppression.33 NOTES 1 Around the 1980s efforts from social movements to transform dominant  cultural behaviours and identities began to be recognized (Goodwin and  Jasper 2006; Johnston, Larana and Gusfield 1994).  2 Fransen and others 2021. 3 Zald, Morrill and Rao 2005. 4 Jenkins, Wallace and Fullerton 2008. 5 Polletta and Jasper 2001. 6 Social movements have questioned the status quo—policies, institutions  and structures—and have shed light on human rights violations, discrimi - nation and violence (Blumer 1951; Christiansen 2009). 7 DeFronzo and Gill 2020; James and Van Seters 2014. 8 Bate, Bevan and Robert 2004. 9 Jasper 2011. 10 Ferree 1992; Flam 1990. 11 Goodwin, Jasper and Polletta 2000. 12 Jasper 2021. 13 Goodwin and Jasper 2006.14 Crutchfield 2018.

CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION 203 Women’s and feminist movements have advanced  women’s rights across a variety of issues, both nation - ally and globally. Feminist mobilizations are associat - ed with better legal rights to participate in economic  life, greater representation in politics, better support  for paid and unpaid domestic care work, better pro - tection from sexual harassment, better access to land  tenure, financial inclusion,1 overcoming stigma and  raising awareness around violence against women  and girls.2 Feminist mobilizations have grown across  every Human Development Index (HDI) group. Low  and medium HDI countries have seen the great - est increases in autonomy and strength of feminist  movements ( figure S6.7 .1). Low HDI countries that  have seen a greater increase in feminist movements include Burkina Faso, Haiti, Liberia, Rwanda, Sen - egal and Uganda. Among medium HDI countries,  Bangladesh, Cameroon, India and Morocco, among  others, have. South Asia and Latin America have had  the highest Feminist Mobilization Index scores on av - erage since 1995, while the Arab States have had the  lowest. Feminist mobilizations defy stereotypes, redefine  boundaries and expand agency for women and girls.  They can open pathways to enhanced wellbeing and  agency for women occupying spaces in all spheres  of life, using their voices to bring new perspectives,  participate equally in society and hold governments  and others in positions of power accountable. Coun - tries with powerful feminist movements or higher  women’s representation in parliaments adopted an  average of five more gender-sensitive measures in  response to the Covid-19 pandemic than countries  without these features.3 Activists in these countries  developed feminist plans and gender budget assess - ments in addition to demanding action to address  violence against women and girls and to improve ac - cess to public services. Two examples are the Gender  and Covid-19 Roundtable with 79 civil society organ - izations in Chile4 and the Women’s Caucus in Brazil’s  legislature5 (Bancada Feminina) advocating for facil - ities that aid women and girls who are subject to vio - lence to be declared essential public services.  Women’s participation in social movements has  promoted changes in traditional gender norms  through two main pathways: policy reforms and re - framing gender roles and power relations.6 Coun - tries with a lower presence of women’s movements  or protests (as measured by the Feminist Mobiliza - tion Index) have the highest biases against gender  equality and women’s empowerment (as measured  by the Gender Social Norms Index; figure S6.7 .2;  see also box S6.7 .1). The elevated risks and costs of  women mobilizing in these contexts are probably Figure S6.7.1 Feminist mobilizations have grown in  autonomy and strength across every Human Development  Index group 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0 1975 1985 1995 2005 2015Feminist Mobilization Index value Very high High Medium Low Human Development Index group Note: The Feminist Mobilization Index combines autonomy and  strength of movements using a dichotomous coding: FMI = Existence +  (Strength*Autonomy). A country without a feminist movement at all is scored  a 0 (FMI = 0 + [0*0] = 0). The index awards 1 point for the existence of a move - ment, so a country with a feminist movement of some variety that is either not  strong or not autonomous is scored a 1 (1 + [1*0] or 1 + [0*1]). A country with a  strong and autonomous feminist movement is scored a 2 (1 + [1*1]). The coun - tries with the strongest autonomous movements are scored a 3 (1 + [2*1] = 3). Source: Forester and others 2022.SPOTLIGHT 6.7 Feminist mobilizations defying gender social norms 204 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 much higher, feeding into a vicious cycle. The asso - ciation between the presence of biases and lower  feminist mobilization appears in political and eco - nomic dimensions: in countries with lower feminist  mobilizations, almost 50 percent of people think men  make better political leaders and more than 40 per - cent think they make better business executives than  women. How are biases against gender equality  and women’s empowerment changing?  The 2022 Gender Social Norms Index Gender inequalities persist, and recent shocks, in - cluding planetary imbalances, the Covid-19 pan - demic and economic crises, are aggravating the  current scenario for women all over the world. The  Gender Inequality Index (GII) reveals a lack of glob - al improvement in its dimensions, with the world  value stagnating at 0.465 for the past three years.  Alarmingly, all regions experienced a decline in GII  value from 2019 to 2020 except South Asia, which experienced an increase; from 2020 to 2021 all re - gions except the Arab States and East Asia and the  Pacific registered a decline.7 While women have seen  some progress in basic capabilities, there are still  challenges in areas that involve greater agency and  power. In 59 countries adult women are more edu - cated than adult men. In those same countries the  income gender gap is 39 percent.8 Behind these cal - culations social norms help us understand these dy - namics of power imbalances.  According to the Gender Social Norms Index,  91 percent of men and 88 percent of women show  at least one clear bias against gender equality in  areas such as politics, economics, education, inti - mate partner violence and women’s reproductive  rights (figure S6.7 .3; see also box S6.7 .1). Men have  high biases in thinking that men make better polit - ical leaders than women do (52.8 percent) and that  men should have more right to a job than women  (50.2 percent). Women present fewer biases across  all dimensions.  This year’s Gender Social Norms Index results pro - vide hope, showing an improvement from the first Figure S6.7.2 Countries with less feminist movements have higher biases against gender equality and women’s  empowerment Percent of people biased Feminist Mobilization Index valueGender Social Norms Index Believe me n make better political leaders than women do Believe me n make better business executives than women do 90.187.6 84.0 73.8 50.6 45.4 41.7 31.444.1 38.8 37.8 28.7 0102030405060708090100 0 1 2 3 Source: UNDP 2020b; Forester and others 2022. 205 CHAPTER 6 — CHARTING PATHS TO TRANSFORMATION time it was calculated. On average, biases against  gender equality and women’s empowerment de - clined from 2010–2014 to 2017–2022 (table S6.7 .1).  Most countries and territories with time-series data  showed progress: women in 23 countries and territo - ries and men in 26 countries and territories showed  reduced biases against gender equality and women’s  empowerment (figure S6.7 .4). Progress in the share  of people with no bias was greater in Germany, New  Zealand, Singapore and Japan. But there were rever - sals in several countries, among women in 14 coun - tries and men in 11 countries. The greatest reversals  took place in the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Chile  and Iraq.Expanding human development and drawing  cultural change in a patriarchal society  In line with the two-tier framework presented in  chapter 6, the different policy blocks can support  the task of defying gender social norms. Investing  in gender-sensitive responses to shocks, especially  initiatives that build partnerships between govern - ments and civil society,9 can help women better cope  with uncertainty. Strengthening and expanding so - cial protection systems to cover women can work as  insurance, increasing their bargaining power at the  household level, promoting financial inclusion, sup - porting long-term income generation and building Box S6.7.1 The Gender Social Norms Index—measuring biases, prejudices and beliefs The Gender Social Norms Index, introduced in the 2019 Human Development Report, comprises four dimensions— political, educational, economic and physical integrity. It is constructed based on responses to seven questions from  the World Values Survey, which are used to create seven indicators (box figure 1).

Source:  Mukhopadhyay, Rivera and Tapia 2019.  For each indicator a variable takes the value of 1 when an individual has a bias and 0 when the individual does not.  The core index value is an aggregation based on the “union approach,” which measures the percentage of people  with biases, independent of the number of biases. In many instances it might take only one bias from one person to  block a woman’s progress in society.  This year’s index covers two sets of countries and territories. The first set consists of countries and territories with  data for wave 5 (2005–2009), wave 6 (2010–2014) or wave 7 (2017–2022) of the World Values Survey (accessed  April 2022) and uses the latest data available. This set includes 76 countries and territories, accounting for more than  84 percent of the global population. The second set consists of only countries and territories with data for wave 6 and  wave 7. This set includes 37 countries and territories, accounting for 48 percent of the global population.

The second tier that targets cultural mismatch - es can go a long way in shifting gender traditional  norms—for example, through gender transformative  education.11 This approach uses the whole education  system (policies, pedagogies and community engage - ment) to transform stereotypes, attitudes and prac - tices regarding power relations and gender binaries  by raising critical consciousness about the root cause  of inequalities. Increasing women’s representation  in public spaces, institutions, governance processes  and leadership positions can change stereotypes and  support changes in laws and policies defending wom - en’s rights. Recognizing the relevance of shifting so - cial norms for gender equality or of women’s right to  body and physical integrity can help change scripts  and narratives to portray women in a certain way and  to build hope.  Feminist movements and women’s different forms  of resistance and action have come a long way, so  amid uncertainty, we can imagine and build a fem - inist future.

As Wagner- Pacifici (2017, p. 1) argues: “Historical events  provoke an enormous sense of uncertainty.  The world seems out of whack, and everyday  routines are, at the least, disrupted. People  often experience a vertiginous sensation that  a new reality or era may be in the making, but  it is one that does not yet have a clear shape  and trajectory, or determined consequences.  [Events imply a] complex dynamic of ‘unknow - ing’ and then reknowing a world transformed  by events.” With relevance to the layer of  uncertainty associated with the Anthropo - cene emphasized in the Report, the author  continues: “[P]lanetary environmental crisis is  an event in which the ground becomes  the  event.” (Wagner-Pacifici 2017, p. 165). 2 UN 2022c, 2022d. 3 UN Global Crisis Response Group on Food  2022. 4 FAO and others 2021. 5 UNDP 2022b. 6 Satake 2014. 7 Toor and others (2021) estimate that the vac - cines covered in their study averted 50 mil - lion deaths from 2000 to 2019.

We are grateful to Toby Ord for  contributing text to this paragraph. 23 These two layers of uncertainty echo the  framing emanating from assessments of the  implications of climate change for financial  stability (see, for instance, BIS 2021), which  distinguishes between two sources of risk  when it comes to valuing assets: physical  risks and transition risks. Physical risks are  associated with how hazards exacerbated by  climate change can lower asset values—for  instance, how floods can lower the value of  houses located near the sea or in flood-prone  areas. Transition risks are associated with  changes in regulation or consumer tastes that  can result in stranded assets—for instance,  if coal-fired power plants are forbidden or  rejected by consumers, the value of coal min - ing and coal-fired power plants can collapse.  Chapter 1 extends this framework by looking  beyond physical risks of climate change to  consider the broader set of challenges asso - ciated with the Anthropocene context and by  looking beyond the climate transition to con - sider the broader set of elements associated  with a transition to ease planetary pressures. 24 Pinto and others 2022. 25 See the discussion in chapter 2 of Black and  others (2022). 26 Diamond 2015; Hyde 2020.  27 Boese and others 2022. 28 Østby, Aas Rustad and Arasmith 2021; UNDP  2022b . 29 UNHCR 2022c. 30 Hinrichs 2021; ILO 2018a.  31 See UNDP (2019). 32 Bollen and others 2021. 33 For example, Ahir, Bloom and Furceri (2022)  constructed a World Uncertainty Index based  on text analysis of Economist Intelligence Unit  reports.

PART I CHAPTER 1 1 At the start of 2022, UN Secretary-General  António Guterres warned world leaders of  increasing divergence between countries,  prompting a “recipe for instability” (UN 2022a),  echoing the need to strengthen multilateral - ism to meet humanity’s greatest challenges,  which was set out in the Secretary-General’s  report Our Common Agenda  (UN 2021c).  2 For example, the Covid-19 pandemic forced  an unprecedented human development  reversal, with decreases in life expectancy  at birth for two consecutive years (UNDP  2022b). Some 1.3 billion people live in multi - dimensional poverty, as of 2021 (UNDP and  OPHI 2020). And inequalities across groups  and in important aspects of human develop - ment are on the rise (UNDP 2019). 3 Uncertainty has been defined as the topic  of the decade by International Monetary  Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva  2020): “If I had to identify a theme at the out - set of the new decade, it would be increasing  uncertainty.” A time of shifting geopolitics,  increasing instability and global tensions has  also been identified by United Nations Secu - rity Council (2021). 4 UNDP 2022b. For further evidence on dis - content, anxieties and feelings of insecurity,  including in some of the richest countries in  the world, see Pinto and others (2022), Pew  Research Center (2021) and UNDP (2022b). 5 “Uncertainty” is used in this chapter and  in the Report to refer to a broad set of pos - sible future outcomes that are not known in  advance with certitude. In economics there is  a long tradition of thinking about uncertainty,  as in the contributions by Keynes (1909) and  Knight (1921). Today, the economics literature  on choice under uncertainty distinguishes  between choice under risk (when there is a  probability distribution associated with a set  of possible events) and choice under ambigu - ity (when the set of possible events is known  but the probability distribution is unknown).  Choices on climate change mitigation are  typically analysed as choices under risk, giv - en that a set of possible outcomes is known  and there are different ways of estimating the probability distributions associated with  them (even though there are disagreements  over what the probability distribution is). In  this context climate change is a source, or  driver, of uncertainty, not because we do not  know that something bad might happen and  not even because we cannot estimate how  likely it is for that to happen, but because  future outcomes are not certain but rather are  defined today in probabilistic terms. Crucially,  our own actions can (still) shape the direction  of our climate, which makes future outcomes  contingent on our choices, among other  things. Probabilities associated with uncertain  events can be estimated in different ways. For  recurrent events frequency of past events is  a common approach, including in the insur - ance industry. For rare or unprecedented  future events models or expert elicitation can  suggest distributions associated with future  events. When no probability distribution can  be derived for future events that can be  specified, we confront choice under ambigu - ity. And, of course, there is also the possibility  of confronting an event that has never been  imagined. All these possibilities fall under the  broad umbrella of uncertainty in this Report. 6 These two layers of uncertainty echo the  framing emanating from assessments of the  implications of climate change for financial  stability (see, for instance, BIS 2021), which  distinguish between two sources of risk when  it comes to valuation of assets: physical risks  and transition risks. Physical risks are as - sociated with how hazards exacerbated by  climate change can lower asset values—for  instance, how floods can lower the value of  houses located near the sea or in flood-prone  areas. Transition risks are associated with  changes in regulation or consumer tastes that  can result in stranded assets—for instance, if  coal-fired power plants are either forbidden  or rejected by consumers, the value of coal  mining and coal-fired power plants can col - lapse. This chapter extends this framework  by looking beyond physical risks of climate  change to consider the broader set of chal - lenges associated with the Anthropocene  context, as well as looking beyond the cli - mate transition to consider the broader set of  elements associated with a transition to ease  planetary pressures. 7 Pinto and others 2022. 8 Delgado 2022. 9 See figure 2.10 in UNDP (2020a).  10 Ellis 2022, p. 15. 11 Bollen and others 2021. 12 Bollen and others 2021; Ahir, Bloom and Furc - eri 2018. 13 The analysis predates the Covid-19 pandemic  and as such would not reflect any effects of  the pandemic. 14 Dodds and others 2015. 15 Martins and Baumard 2020. 16 Fan and others 2019; Helliwell and others  2022; Maurer and Holbach 2016. 17 Helliwell and others 2022; Jaidka and others  2020.18 For example, Ahir, Bloom and Furceri (2022)  constructed a World Uncertainty Index based  on text analysis of Economist Intelligence Unit  reports. They found that concerns about un - certainty have been steadily increasing since  2012, with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic  prompting a historical peak of the index. 19 Ayers and others 2020; Fetzer and others  2021.

For example, a recent  study found that a majority of people in 17 ad - vanced economies believe that the children  growing up today will be financially worse  off than their parents (Pew Research Center  2021). Yet other studies point towards young  people holding more optimistic views of their  future and the future of the world, at least  prior to the Covid-19 pandemic (Ipsos and Bill  & Melinda Gates Foundation 2018), particu - larly those in developing countries (UNICEF  2021a).  25 Choi and others 2022. 26 The Gallup Organization 2022. 27 Psychology research shows that while uncer - tainty in controlled situations—such as gam - bling—may be exciting, uncertainty is also  a major cause of stress, especially among  those with low tolerance of uncertainty or  when linked to situations in which we can - not rely on previous experience to inform  decisionmaking (Grupe and Nitschke 2013;  Harvard Medical School 2020; Tanovic, Gee  and Joormann 2018). 28 Pinto and others 2022; UNDP 2022b. 29 UNDP 2019. 30 World Bank 2020a. 31 UNDP and OPHI 2020. 32 Roser 2021. 33 Fleurbaey 2018, p. 42. 34 IPCC 2021, 2022b. 35 Malhi 2017. 36 The final adoption of a new epoch by the  stratigraphic community remains under con - sideration (Voosen 2022a). The proposal was  formally put forward by a working group set  up to consider the evidence in favour of a  new geological epoch (Zalasiewicz and oth - ers 2017). Recently, a suggestion was made to  characterize the Anthropocene as an unfold - ing geological event, rather than a geological  epoch with clear markers (Bauer and others  2021). See the 2020 Human Development  216 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 Report (UNDP 2020a) for a review of the  evidence, as well as the debate from multiple  perspectives from the natural sciences, social  sciences and humanities that the Anthropo - cene frame has motivated. 37 UNDP 2020a. 38 The argument that having power over some - thing creates an obligation to act (either  towards improving an outcome or stop some - thing that is harmful) has a long tradition in  ethical reasoning. For instance, it was invoked  by Buddha as the argument for why humans  should not harm nonhuman life. This example  and argument draw from Sen (2009b). 39 Ellis 2021; Ellis and others 2021. 40 Marra and others 2021. 41 Reyers 2017. 42 Polasky and others 2020. See also Lenton  (2019) and Lovejoy (2019). 43 The latest IPCC report shows that it is virtu - ally impossible that the acceleration of global  warming since 1970 has a geological cause.  Without stark action, human-induced emis - sions are expected to increase average tem - peratures by 1.5°C within the next 20 years,  with potential catastrophic consequences for  humans (IPCC 2021). 44 IPCC 2021. 45 Elhacham and others 2020. 46 IPBES 2019b; Pörtner and others 2021. 47 IPCC 2022b. 48 Carlson and others 2022.  49 Carlson and others 2022. 50 Marani and others 2021. 51 Rohr and others 2019. 52 WHO 2021g. 53 Kotz, Wenz and Levermann 2021. 54 CUNY Advanced Science Research Center  2021; see also Vörösmärty and others 2020. 55 Kotz and others 2021, p. 319. 56 Guo and others 2016. 57 Kotz, Wenz and Levermann 2021. 58 Guo and others 2016. 59 Kotz and others 2021. 60 Keys and others 2019. 61 Climate simulations are susceptible to an  inherent model uncertainty—across and  within models (Barnett, Brock and Hansen  2020). Some major sources of uncertainty  are derived from the evolution of greenhouse  gas emissions—which will be influenced by  human choices and policies—and the feed - back loops between different ecosystem  processes (Hausfather and others 2022). For  example, implementing a carbon tax will im - pact the cost of carbon, influence consump - tion and production choices and ultimately  affect emissions. But the optimal rate of such  a tax is difficult to identify, due to uncertainty  about the true social cost of carbon (Bar - nett, Brock and Hansen 2020) and whether people will accept such a tax (see, for ex - ample, the “yellow vest” fuel tax protests in  France). Thus, the assumptions made when  projecting future temperatures may lead to  vastly different conclusions (Hausfather and  others 2022), and researchers have been  raising a warning flag for a new generation of  “hot models” that overestimate temperature  increases (Voosen 2022b). Averaging projec - tions from different models is one way to deal  with model uncertainty, but too-hot models  may exaggerate the impact of emissions on  warming. The latest IPCC report instead mod - elled results based on different degrees of  warming, again illustrating the wide range of  possible outcomes. Inherent uncertainty in cli - mate models does not mean that warming is  not happening; indeed, the latest IPCC report  shows that average temperatures on Earth  are now 1°C higher than before the Industrial  Revolution, which without reasonable doubt is  due to human-induced emissions (IPCC 2021).  How emissions will evolve going forward, and  what their impact will be on temperatures and  the planet, is largely up to us.  62 See for example, the latest IPCC report, which  integrates cross-disciplinary insights into the  assessments of climate change risks. Based  on an understanding of the interdependent  adaptation of human societies and ecosys - tems, the report shows that—in the context of  climate change—human responses to climate  change add new layers of opportunity and  risk (IPCC 2022b).  63 Dosio and others 2018. 64 History can provide important insights.  Sometimes history is invoked to provide  cautionary tales for today’s world based on  narratives of ecocides in the past, in which  “civilizational collapse” was the outcome of  overusing natural resources. A popular read - ing of this narrative was based on Diamond  (2005). Recognizing that “[t]he chief practical  use of history is to deliver us from plausible  historical analogies” (James Bryce, cited in  Müller 2002, p. 5), a more recent account of  the historical record, made possible in part by  advances in technologies ranging from Earth  observation to the analysis of DNA deep into  the past, suggests that this account has been  oversimplified. 65 Degroot 2019; Degroot and others 2021. 66 Xu and others 2020. 67 UNDP 2020a. 68 UNDP 2022b. 69 Chancel and others 2022. 70 See table 6.6 in Chancel and others (2022). 71 Chancel and others 2022. 72 Chancel and others 2022. 73 Jafino and others 2020. 74 For example, pollution is a major health  threat, causing one in six deaths every year.  Over time, there has been a decrease in  poverty-related pollution-related deaths, such  as death due to polluted drinking water, but  deaths due pollution from industrialization,  such as toxic chemicals, have increased by more than 60 percent since the start of the  21st century, indicating that new gaps in pollu - tion inequality are opening (Fuller and others  2022). 75 Wing and others 2022. 76 Osman-Elasha n.d. 77 Some have even argued that the unequal  dynamics of climate change are reason for  “limitarianism” in income and wealth (Robeyns  2019). 78 Frank 2020. 79 Appadurai 2004. 80 La Ferrara 2019; Fruttero, Muller and Calvo- González 2021. 81 Conradie and Robeyns 2013. 82 Frank 2020. 83 Genicot and Ray 2017, 2020. 84 Greenaway, Frye and Cruwys 2015. 85 Lybbert and Wydick 2018. 86 Ord 2020.

In an adverse scenario,  where changes are too late and too sudden,  transitional uncertainties will be amplified,  transcending through different parts of our  economy and society (Gros and others 2016). 98 UNDP 2020a. 99 One way of taking an integrated perspective  on the multiple transitions to ease planetary  pressures and incorporating the role of tech - nological change is to draw on the approach  of the 2020 Human Development Report  (UNDP 2020a). Every form of life uses energy  and materials and sends them back to nature,  but the footprint of humans far exceeds that of  any other species. For most of human history,  the use of energy and materials was not too  far from the limits of their biological metabo - lism; it was not until the Industrial Revolution  that humans began to capture and use energy  and materials at a scale comparable to the  biosphere. Sociometabolic research provides  NOTES 217 deeper insights into how society interacts with  nature and studies biophysical flows across  them and how such a relationship evolves  over time (Haberl and others 2011). Bringing  the disciplines of economics and sociology  together with earth and natural sciences, it ex - plores how matter and energy change forms  as they are extracted and used by societies. In  human history major advances in technology  followed transitions to higher energy inputs  and altered material cycles, leading to new so - cial and environmental orders. In many cases  the step increases in energy resulted in more  waste products disrupting the environment,  initially on a local scale and now at the plan - etary scale (Lenton, Pichler and Weisz 2016). 100 UNDP 2020a. 101 Smil 2022. 102 Smil 2022. 103 Bai and others 2016. 104 Cai 2020. 105 Balta-Ozkan, Watson and Mocca 2015; Gamb - hir, Green and Pearson 2018. 106 ILO 2018b. 107 Bergant, Mano and Shibata 2022. 108 Bolton, Adrian and Kleinnijenhuis 2022. 109 Lieu and others 2020. 110 Haberl and others 2011; Krausmann and oth - ers 2008; UNDP 2020a.  111 The global weighted-average levelized cost  of utility-scale solar photovoltaics fell by 85  percent between 2010 and 2020; during the  same period the global weighted-average  cost of electricity from onshore wind projects  fell by 56 percent (IRENA 2021). 112 IEA 2021c. 113 BP 2020. 114 Graham-Rowe 2011. 115 Rulli and others 2016. 116 Jeswani, Chilvers and Azapagic 2020. 117 Verdade, Piña and Rosalino 2015. 118 Webb and Coates 2012. 119 Oehlschlaeger, Wang and Sexton 2013. 120 Hertel 2009. 121 Sepulveda and others 2021. 122 Bolton and others 2020; NGFS 2019. 123 Campiglio and others 2018. 124 The White House 2022.  125 NGFS 2021. 126 Erlanger and Sengupta 2021.  127 Peszko and others 2020. 128 Engebretsen and Anderson 2020. 129 Smith and Brower 2022. 130 Alderman 2021. 131 The renewable energy sector currently em - ploys 12 million people worldwide, with the  sector expected to grow to provide 114 million  jobs, assuming current policies and pledges are successfully executed.

Both agriculture and  mining, human activities that exert pressures  on the planet, have been linked to serious hu - man rights issues in low- and middle-income  countries. For example, almost 70 percent of  all child labour and almost 30 percent of peo - ple in modern slavery are found in agriculture.  Hazardous work conditions, child labour and  other violations are linked to artisanal mining  of various metals (Sellare and others 2022). 143 Sonter and others 2020.  144 Rehbein and others 2020. 145 These estimates vary considerably across  studies depending on model assumptions  of anticipated policies, types of technologies  and timeframe, among others; however, even  under an ambitious assumption of reuse and  recycle, the rate of mining will have to in - crease multifold (Hund and others 2020; IEA  2021b; Sovacool and others 2020). 146 Heffernan 2019. 147 Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel  2021. 148 Race 2019. 149 UNDP 2020a. 150 WWF Australia 2021. 151 Hataway 2017. 152 Circle Economy 2020.  153 MaterialFlows 2022. 154 Bringezu and others 2017; OECD 2019a. 155 Circle Economy 2020; Veidis and others  2022.  156 Elhacham and others 2020. 157 OECD 2020a. 158 IAEA 2018. 159 Schlesinger and Bernhardt 2013. 160 Kinzig and Socolow 1994. 161 Eutrophication happens when the mineral  and nutrient levels in a body of water increase  excessively.

In this approach  risk is seen as a failure to fulfil the central  elements of the reference narrative. Resolv - able uncertainty is uncertainty that can be  resolved by looking something up or that can  be represented by a known probability distri - bution of outcomes. With radical uncertainty,  however, there is no similar means of resolv - ing the uncertainty—we simply do not know. 170 WEF 2020a. 171 Studley 2021. 172 Business of Apps 2022. 173 Hilbert 2022. 174 Jacob and Akpan 2015. 175 Mirchandani 2018; Mutahi and Kimari 2017. 176 Midgley and others 2021.  177 Neophytou, Manwell and Eikelboom 2021. 178 Brady and others 2017. 179 Messing and Weisel 2017.  180 Immordino-Yang, Christodoulou and Singh  2012. 181 Levy 2021. 182 Mitchell, Gottfried and Matsa 2015. 183 Kreps 2020. 184 Nowotny 2021. 185 OpenAI and Pilipiszyn 2022. 186 Imperva 2016. 187 Vosoughi, Roy and Aral 2018. 188 O’Neil 2016. 189 Ciancaglini and others 2020. 190 Hill 2020. 191 de Ágreda 2020. 192 Acemoglu 2021. 193 Meenakshi 2022. 194 Meenakshi 2022. 195 Prabhune 2022. 196 Cyranoski and Ledford 2018. 197 Mehravar and others 2019. 198 Lanphier and others 2015. 199 Waltz 2022. 200 Waltz and Nature Biotechnology 2021. 201 Aslam and others 2022. 202 Selfa, Lindberg and Bain 2021. 203 Stiglitz and Guzman 2021. 218 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 204 Polasky and others 2020. 205 Kay and King 2020. 206 Klein and Kruglanski 2013; van Baar, Halpern  and FeldmanHall 2021. 207 Funke, Schularick and Trebesch 2016. 208 Boese and others 2022. 209 Boese and others 2022. 210 Boese and others 2022; International IDEA  2021; Repucci and Slipowitz 2022. 211 Stiglitz and Guzman 2021. 212 Druckman 2017. 213 Pinto and others 2022. 214 Lopes da Silva, Tian and Marksteiner 2021;  Pettersson and others 2021.  215 UNDP 2022b. 216 Aas Rustad 2021; UNDP 2022b. 217 Arasmith, Østby and Aas Rustad 2022. 218 Collins, Florin and Sachs 2021; Darbyshire  2021. 219 Burke, Hsiang and Miguel 2015; Hsiang, Burke  and Miguel 2013; Mach and Kraan 2021. 220 McCool and others 2022. 221 UNDP 2022b. 222 Consider the 20-fold increase in water- related conflicts since 1970 (SIPRI 2021) or the  contestations around mineral resources (Aas  Rustad and others 2022). 223 Lazard 2021. 224 UNDP 2021a. 225 Keys and others 2019; Polasky and others  2020; Wassénius and Crona 2022.

CHAPTER 2 1 Distress is defined as “the negative stress  response, often involving negative affect and  physiological reactivity: a type of stress that  results from being overwhelmed by demands,  losses, or perceived threats.” It implies  “a  negative emotional state in which the spe - cific quality of the emotion is unspecified or  unidentifiable”  (American Psychological As - sociation 2022). 2 These concepts are based on Sen (1999). 3 Mani and others 2013; Ridley and others  2020; WHO 2022b. 4 Martha Nussbaum and others have repeat - edly argued that emotions are crucial in the debate of human development. Nussbaum  considers emotions one of her 10 fundamen - tal capabilities, pointing out the importance of  love, grief, longing, gratitude and justified an - ger without having these emotions distorted  by fear and anxiety (Nussbaum 2003a). Other  important works include Comim (2011), Hirai,  Comim and Ikemoto (2016) and Nussbaum  (1995, 2003b). 5 Pessoa 2019. 6 The influence of culture has been well estab - lished in the literature for decades. Not only  do different cultures have different “tool kits”  with habits, skills and styles that people use to  develop action strategies, but most important,  patterns of human thought develop in cul - tural settings, shaping the functioning of our  minds. In unsettled times culture also shapes  people’s behaviour through persisting ide - ologies that people apply to determine their  actions (Lamont and others 2017; Nisbett and  Norenzayan 2002; Swidler 1986; Tomasello  2016). 7 The literature finds, for instance, that fearful  people have a stronger risk aversion than  angry people, who tend to make risk-seeking  choices (Lerner and Keltner 2001). 8 Gordon and Mendes 2021. 9 Human development is the process of enlarg - ing people’s choices so that each and every  individual can develop his or her full potential  (UNDP 1990). 10 The concept of resilience is used in many dif - ferent ways in the psychology literature but is  used here in the sense of mental immunity,  in which people do not develop mental disor - ders despite facing toxic stress (Davydov and  others 2010). 11 Brännlund, Strandh and Nilsson 2017. 12 Bubonya, Cobb-Clark and Wooden 2017. 13 Callander and Schofield 2018. 14 Saxena 2018. 15 Sen 1979, 1989, 1997a, 1999, 2008. 16 McEwen and McEwen 2017. 17 Center on the Developing Child 2013, 2021;  National Scientific Council on the Developing  Child 2020. 18 Center on the Developing Child 2021. 19 McEwen and McEwen 2017; National Scien - tific Council on the Developing Child 2020. 20 Dallman 2010; Danese and Lewis 2017;  Danese and others 2014; Evans and Wachs  2010; Hackett and Steptoe 2017; Hughes and  others 2017; Morris and others 2019. 21 Ignatow 2021. 22 Basic trust refers to the trust that is developed  during infancy when needs are met by care - givers. The baby develops trust in itself, the  world and those who surround it. This trust  develops further during childhood, when  children can consistently rely on caregivers  (Erikson 1993). 23 Center on the Developing Child 2013, 2021;  McEwen and McEwen 2017.

Since this is a new area of research,  some of these studies point out that more  research is needed to fully confirm this effect  and explain the channels through which it  works. 30 Lengfelder 2021. These are what Martha  Nussbaum considers essential capabilities  (Nussbaum 2003a, 2015). 31 Ungar and Theron 2020. 32 For example, more than 55 million people  around the world live with dementia, with  almost 10 million new cases every year. De - mentia results from a variety of diseases and  injuries with impact on the brain. Alzheimer’s  disease is the most common form of demen - tia and contributes to about 60–70 percent of  cases (WHO 2021b). 33 UNDP 2020a. 34 Berry, Bowen and Kjellstrom 2010; Berry and  others 2018; Cianconi, Betrò and Janiri 2020;  Crabtree 2012; Hayes and others 2018; Padhy  and others 2015; Palinkas and Wong 2020. 35 Berry, Bowen and Kjellstrom 2010. 36 Cianconi, Betrò and Janiri 2020; Miles-Novelo  and Anderson 2019; Padhy and others 2015. 37 For a detailed analysis about this—including  two case studies, one on Finland and one on  Tuvalu—see Crabtree (2022b). 38 Clayton 2020; Taylor 2020. 39 A recent survey involving 10,000 young  people (ages 16-25) from 10 countries from  around the world found that over 60 percent  of young people are sad, afraid or anxious  about climate change. Many of them feel that  governments are failing young people (65  percent) or are even lying about the impact  of their actions in response to climate change  (64 percent).

In New  Zealand distress was higher among women  and girls than among men and boys, while in  the United States adolescents’ mental health  was impaired by food insecurity, with the ef - fect remaining significant even after extreme  poverty was controlled for.44 Trudell and others 2021. 45 Cunsolo and Ellis. 2018; Maguire 2020;  Middleton and others 2020; Willox and others  2013. 46 Middleton and others 2020. Interactions  between biodiversity and mental wellbeing  remain poorly understood, with studies con - ducted among wealthier populations yielding  mixed and inconclusive results (Hedin and  others 2022; IPBES 2019a; Marselle and oth - ers 2019).

Its findings were echoed by another multi - country study in which female caregivers of  children ages 5–18 across Australia, Canada,  the United Kingdom and the United States  experienced higher levels of distress, anxiety  and post-traumatic stress than male caregiv - ers (Wade and others 2021). 58 Proto and Quintana-Domeque 2021. 59 Bender and Theodossiou 2018; Christian,  Hensel and Roth 2019; Hjelm and others  2017; Johnston, Shields and Suziedelyte  2020; Kopasker, Montagna and Bender 2018;  Martin-Carrasco and others 2016; Ridley and  others 2020. 60 Biasi, Dahl and Moser 2021; Ridley and others  2020.61 Smith and others 2021. 62 Persson and Rossin-Slater 2018; Ridley and  others 2020. 63 McEwen and McEwen 2017. A study from  Ghana shows that in cacao-producing regions  decreases in cacao prices by the time a child  is born have adverse effects on the child’s  mental health that last until adulthood and  can result in fewer economic opportunities  (Adhvaryu, Fenske and Nyshadham 2019). 64 Diorio and Meaney 2007. 65 National Scientific Council on the Developing  Child 2020. 66 Troller-Renfree and others 2022. Similarly,  another study from Malawi shows how uncon - ditional cash transfers improve mental health  among young people, especially among  young women (Angeles and others 2019). In a  different setting unconditional cash transfers  in Zambia did not reduce stress levels, even  though stress levels were highly correlated  with perceived food insecurity, which was  improved by the extra income (Hjelm and oth - ers 2017). The positive effect of cash transfers  on mental wellbeing is also valid for adults in  low- and middle-income countries (McGuire,  Kaiser and Bach-Mortensen 2022). 67 Evans and Kim 2012; Evans and Wachs 2010;  McEwen and McEwen 2017. 68 Wuepper and Lybbert 2017. 69 Evans, Li and Whipple 2013. 70 Evans, Li and Whipple 2013; O’Rand and  Hamil-Luker 2005.

When comparing  socioeconomic status within countries,  people with low socioeconomic status in de - veloped countries suffer higher psychological  burden than people with low socioeconomic  in developing countries. Religion may play a  role in this association, as religious norms al - leviate the burden of poverty (Berkessel and  others 2021). In countries with a strong long- standing presence of Christian churches, one  of the cultural differences that was identified  with respect to other countries was less con - formity and more individualism among people  220 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 (Gelfand 2019). Alternative or complementary  explanations, apart from church influence,  are the effect of perceived inequality, social  comparison and peer pressure that cause  psychological burden for the low-income  population in some developed countries  (Wilkinson and Pickett 2009). 79 Marmot 2005; Ridley and others 2020. 80 Genicot and Ray 2020; McKenzie, Mohpal  and Yang 2021. See also UNDP (2019). 81 The ability to appear in public without shame,  first suggested by Adam Smith, is crucial to  the human development approach, not least  because it impacts agency—the ability to act  and bring about change (Sen 2005). 82 Lundberg, Kristenson and Starrin 2009. For  some people, growing prosperity is reflected  in the “American Dream” of faring better than  one’s parents, which may be more difficult to  achieve now than it was a few decades ago— not least because of a mismatch between  expectations based on past conditions and  available opportunities in the present (hys - teresis; Lamont 2019). See also commentary  by Frye (2019). On the argument about hys - teresis, see Ayala-Hurtado (2021). In light of  massive uncertainties, cultural braiding—the  process of “creatively redefining, melding  and combining elements from pre-existing  cultural repertoires that form the cultural sup - ply on which people draw to form their  worldviews”—may help younger generations  overcome the mismatch between expecta - tions and reality and adapt to and navigate an  unpredictable future (Zilberstein, Lamont and  Sanchez 2021, p. 3). 83 Pleeging, Burger and van Exel 2021. Educa - tion and political systems seem to play a role  in the relation among believe, hope and well - being. Case and Deaton (2015, 2020) find that  “deaths of despair” (deaths due to substance  abuse or suicide) have risen substantially  among the middle-aged White working popu - lation without college degree in the United  States since the 1990s. The authors make  psychological distress partly caused by the  capitalist system responsible for this develop - ment. However, parts of their argument have  been contested. Ruhm (2018)’s study of differ - ent counties in the United States argues that  the effect of economic decline on mortality is  minimal. 84 Loibl and others 2021. 85 Evidence for the United States has consis - tently shown that college graduates who  begin their working lives in a recession earn  less for up to 15 years than those that start  work when an economy is expanding (Kahn  2010; Oreopoulos, von Wachter and Heisz  2012; Oyer 2006; Wozniak 2010). This effect  is magnified for high school graduates, and  the negative effects extend beyond income,  also affecting health, leading to higher mor - tality than those who enter the labour force  during prosperous times (Schwandt and Von  Wachter 2019, 2020). 86 For instance, a study found that the bad luck  of young men who suffered a health shock  (the study considered only the effect of pater - nal ancestry) negatively influenced the health of descendants up to grandchildren, with a  magnitude as important as in utero conditions  or children’s socioeconomic status (Costa  2021). 87 Bianchi, Bianchi and Song 2021. It is also  linked to higher risk aversion (evidence from  Japan in Shigeoka 2019), reflecting a long- term scarring of beliefs, in a persistent ex - pectation of a higher likelihood of an extreme  negative shock in the future, with long-term  costs that are many times higher than the  short-term costs typically accounted for when  there are losses in economic output (Kozlows - ki, Veldkamp and Venkateswaran 2020). 88 Mani and others 2013; Ridley and others  2020. 89 Kaur and others 2021. 90 de Bruijn and Antonides 2021; Mani and oth - ers 2013. 91 Shah and others 2018.

Psychological  treatments have been shown to be effective  and are often able to mitigate this effect, elimi - nating up to a third of the income penalty. The  benefits of treatments are strongest among  people with lower income, which indicates  potential for decreasing income inequality. 96 Alloush 2021. 97 UN 2021a.

Since these inequalities  change quickly, institutional aspects should  be considered to understand patterns and  interactions involving the private sector,  consumer choices and government policies  (DiMaggio and Hargittai 2001). 114 In Wuhan, China, frequent social media use  was associated with symptoms of anxiety  during the first outbreak (January–February  2020; Gao and others 2020).

In the United States, for instance, 69 percent  of women and 34 percent of men who had  experienced sexual or physical violence  with an intimate partner during their lifetime  report suffering from symptoms of PTSD,  being fearful, being concerned for safety,  needing medical care or needing help from  law enforcement and missed at least one  day of work or school (Smith and others  2018). Similarly, a retrospective cohort study  in the United Kingdom found that women  who had been exposed to intimate partner  violence were nearly three times as likely to  be diagnosed with mental disorders, almost  twice as likely to suffer from anxiety and three  times as likely to be depressed as unexposed  women (Chandan and others 2020). Likewise,  a national survey from El Salvador observed  that women who had experienced intimate  partner violence showed a significantly higher  prevalence of mental disorders and suicidal  tendencies than those who had not (Navarro- Mantas, de Lemus and Megías 2021). 138 Cimino and others 2019; Daugherty and oth - ers 2020; Ivany and others 2018; Smirl and  others 2019. 139 Brenisen 2020. 140 Greene and others 2018.

The study used  national panel data from South Africa and  found a strong link between exposure to  heightened levels of neighbourhood violence  and depressive symptoms, especially among  poor people living in urban neighbourhoods.  It argues that a psychological poverty trap  arises when individuals with lower incomes  live in neighbourhoods with lower rent and housing prices, which are often dispropor - tionately affected by violence, with detrimen - tal consequences on mental health and thus  abilities to work and generate income. 151 See also Fowler and others (2009) and Mc - Coy, Roy and Raver (2016).

CHAPTER 3 1 Institutions in the broadest sense, as pro - posed by Douglass North to represent formal  rules as well as social norms and expecta - tions (North 1990), and including social ar - rangements that take the form of regulations  and other public policies. 2 One approach would be to assume how  people behave and then define an ideal set  of institutions that would deliver intended  outcomes based on those behavioural  assumptions. “There is a long tradition in  economic and social analysis of identify - ing the realization of justice with what is  taken to be the right institutional structure.  There are a great many examples of such a  concentration on institutions, with powerful  advocacy for alternative institutional visions  of a just society, varying from the panacea  of wonderfully performing free markets and  free trade to the Shangri-La of socially owned  means of production and magically efficient  central planning. There are, however, good  evidential reasons to think that none of these  grand institutional formulae typically deliver  what their visionary advocates hope, and that  their actual success in generating good social  222 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 realizations is thoroughly contingent on vary - ing social, economic, political and cultural  circumstances” (Sen 2009b, p. 83). Thus, this  approach, always fraught, may be particularly  unsuited to novel uncertain times in which a  fundamental transformation is being pursued. 3 Sen 2009b. 4 This argument is based on Sen (2009b),  contrasting contractual approaches to justice,  exemplified by several theories of the social  contract, with an approach based on social  choice, in which the world is constantly as - sessed, and injustices are addressed through  public reasoning that determines institutions  and behaviour. 5 Recognizing that capabilities are not the only  thing that matters. International cooperation  for development and social and economic  policies often focus on one aspect of capa - bilities: the deprivations and inequalities in  opportunities leading to achievements in  wellbeing, such as having income to meet ba - sic standards of living and being healthy and  educated enough to participate in economic,  social and political life. There is good reason  for this focus when the claims for assistance  from others or from the state are associated  with deprivations in these capabilities. This  focus assumes even greater force when  someone is living in extreme poverty or suf - fering from hunger. Human Development  Reports over the years have emphasized  wellbeing achievements associated with ba - sic capabilities in standards of living, health or  education — also the inspiration for the Human  Development Index (HDI). The HDI provides  a natural way to compare countries and as - sess development progress over time, in a  more informationally plural way than relying  narrowly on national income. The reversal in  HDI values documented in chapter 1 shows  how important it is to continue pursuing this  emphasis. 6 “The possibilities of affecting human behav - iour through means other than economic  incentives may be a great deal more substan - tial than is typically assumed in the economic  literature. The rigid correspondence between  choice, preferences, and welfare assumed  in traditional economic theory makes the  analysis simpler but also rules out important  avenues of social and economic change”  (Sen 1973, p. 254). 7 Rational in quotation marks to signify the nar - row perspective that assumes that people be - have rationally only if they behave according  to these assumptions. Behaviour deviating  from these assumptions does not imply that  it is irrational, only that it does not conform to  the assumptions. 8 As early as 1955, Herbert Simon (1955, p. 99)  wrote: “Broadly stated, the task is to replace  the global rationality of economic man with  the kind of rational behaviour that is compat - ible with the access to information and the  computational capacities that are actually  possessed by organisms, including man, in  the kinds of environments in which such  organisms exist.” Daniel Kahneman (2003),  a leading contributor to behavioural science,  titled his review of his contributions to the field that were recognized with a Nobel Prize  “Maps of Bounded Rationality.” 9 While the standard economic model includes  social determinants (that is, elements that  are shared and not attached exclusively to  agents), they are typically limited to either  prices or the “rules of the game” that may  be in place to constrain choice. The rules of  the game are often equated with institutions,  in the broad sense proposed by North (1990)  to represent formal rules as well as social  norms and expectations. They are part of indi - vidual beliefs that enter rational choice. For a  broader discussion of the (underappreciated)  relevance of beliefs, see Basu (2018). As Hoff   and Stiglitz (2016) argue, these social determi - nants influence only the choice sets available  to agents, not any social determinants of the  actual choice. 10 Granovetter 1985, 2005. More recently, Greif  and Mokyr (2017, p.  25) argued that beliefs  (which Douglass North assumed to be individ - ually held) are actually socially constructed on  the basis of cognitive rules that “summarize  society’s beliefs and experience.” 11 For many years some of these findings were  popularized among economists in a feature  of the Journal of Economic Perspectives  titled “Anomalies.” In one of the contributions,  it was explained that “economics can be  distinguished from other social sciences by  the belief that most (all?) behaviour can be  explained by assuming that rational agents  with stable, well-defined preferences interact  in markets that (eventually) clear. An empirical  result qualifies as an anomaly if it is difficult to  ‘rationalize’ or if implausible assumptions are  necessary to explain it within the paradigm”  (Rabin and Thaler 2001, p. 219). An early re - view of the impact of a more complex under - standing of human psychology in economics  is Rabin (1998). A more recent review of the  field is Thaler (2018). Implications for devel - opment economics have been reviewed in  World Bank (2015), Demeritt and Hoff (2018)  and Kremer, Rao and Schilbach (2019). 12 [Economic analysis] “underestimates that [a  human] is a social animal and that his choices  are not rigidly bound to his own preferences  only. I do not find it difficult to believe that  birds and bees and dogs and cats do reveal  their preferences by their choice; it is with  human beings that the proposition is not  particularly persuasive. An act of choice for  this social animal is, in a fundamental sense,  always a social act” (Sen 1973, pp. 252–253). 13 Sen 1977. 14 Paraphrasing from Dawes and Thaler (1988,  p. 196). 15 Sen 1997b, p. 749. 16 A change in goals triggers a reorganization  of the neural representation of value, which  explains flexible behaviour Castegnetti, Zurita  and Martino (2021). 17 Which may or may not be mediated through  personal wellbeing. 18 Sen 1997b, p.  751. For the interplay among  narratives and imperatives and more reason - ing, see Bénabou, Falk and Tirole (2018).19 Hoff and Stiglitz 2016. 20 Some interesting evidence about the rel - evance of reference points comes from the  times that marathon runners take to complete  the course, which are significantly bunched  around round numbers (that is, at 3 hours, 3.5  hours and so on; Allen and others 2017). 21 Unlike what is assumed in expected utility  theory, as described in spotlight 3.3 (Tversky  and Kahneman 1974). 22 The neural basis for loss aversion is docu - mented in Tom and others (2007).

The refer - ence point that people use to make these  valuations can be based on either something  people actually have or some expectation  about what they believe may or should hap - pen (Kőszegi and Rabin 2006, 2007). 25 Samuelson and Zeckhauser 1988. 26 Rabin and Thaler 2001. 27 Tversky and Kahneman 1992. Although  evidence suggests that the way in which  people acquire information about probabili - ties matters: this behaviour is observed when  probabilities are described but not necessar - ily when they are learned from experience  (Hotaling and others 2019). 28 Zelizer 1989, 2017. 29 Cohen, Shin and Liu 2019; Collins and others  2009. 30 Narrow framing was proposed to account for  the evaluation of a specific risk separately  from other risks, along with insights from  prospect theory by Benartzi and Thaler (1995)  to explain the equity premium puzzle (the fact  that average returns on risky assets such as  real estate and stocks historically exceed  those of safe assets such as short-term  bonds) by much more than expected utility  theory would predict. For the regularity of this  differential in returns across countries and  over time, see Jordà and others (2019). 31 Bordalo, Gennaioli and Shleifer 2012, 2021. 32 The case has been made many times and  in a very compelling way, as reviewed in  chapter 5 of the 2020 Human Development  Report (UNDP 2020a), for instance. 33 Present bias, giving greater weight to pro - spective gains that are coming sooner rather  than later (O’Donoghue and Rabin 1999) might  also contribute to the behavioural agent giv - ing pause. 34 Erickson and others 2020; Oreskes 2019;  Oreskes and Conway 2011; Supran and  Oreskes 2021. 35 More generally, Atkinson and Jacquet (2022)  show how many of the cognitive biases, or  psychological traits more broadly, that are  invoked as reasons why people will oppose  action on climate change have a counterar - gument that suggests they could also drive  NOTES 223 behaviour that would support action against  climate change.

Sometimes emotions  are presented as “irrational,” something that  Sen (2009b) rejects, in line with Smith’s view.  For explorations of the role of emotions in  behaviour, see Elster (1998) and Loewenstein  (2000). 53 LeDoux and Brown 2017. 54 Lerner, Small and Loewenstein 2004. 55 Dorison and others 2020. 56 Elster 2021a. 57 Lynch, Broomhall and Davidson 2019. 58 Long and others 2020. 59 Pleeging, Burger and van Exel 2020. 60 See Bechara, Damasio and Damasio (2000),  who suggest that bioregulatory processes— some conscious, others unconscious—take  expression in the form of emotions that make it  impossible to separate the emotional from the  other elements involved in decisionmaking. 61 Bechara and Damasio 2005. 62 Dunn, Dalgleish and Lawrence 2006. 63 Blanchette and Richards 2010; FeldmanHall  and Chang 2018. 64 Dukes and others 2021. 65 Lerner and others 2015. 66 This example, and the discussion in this para - graph, borrows from Sen (2009b). 67 For the review that inspired the discussion in  this section, see Bénabou and Tirole (2016).68 For the valence and instrumental value of  optimism, the extent to which people hold  generalized favourable expectancies about  the future, see Carver, Scheier and Seger - strom (2010). 69 As argued in Elster (2015). 70 Bénabou and Tirole 2016. identify three  mechanisms: strategic ignorance (for in - stance, refusing to be tested for Huntington’s  disease, despite knowing that one is at risk),  denial of reality (rationalizing, distorting or  dampening warning signs of, for instance, a  housing market crash before the incontrovert - ible crash does happen) and self-signalling  (pushing through work even though one feels  sick, to validate the belief that all is fine). 71 Kahan 2013; Kahan and others 2017a, 2017b.  Even though the robustness of some of these  findings is under scrutiny (Tappin, Pennycook  and Rand 2020), perhaps the more relevant  and robust point is that higher cognitive  achievements do not impede motivated  reasoning. 72 Christensen and Moynihan 2020. 73 Martinez 2022. 74 Thaler 2020; Van Bavel and others 2022. 75 Barron, Becker and Huck 2022. 76 Bonomi, Gennaioli and Tabellini 2021. In his  empirical account of income and voter pat - terns, Piketty (2020) demonstrates a shift in  many countries in political preferences across  income groups, where class-based or income- based voting seem to have given way to vot - ing patterns along other fault lines, such as  education (see also spotlight 4.1 in chapter 4). 77 For an argument as to how epistemic norms  are social norms, see Henderson (2020). Levy  (2022, p. xiii) puts it succinctly: “[T]hose who  come to hold bad beliefs do so for roughly  the same sorts of reasons as those who come  to hold good beliefs. It isn’t because they’re  irrational and we’re not. It is largely because  we defer to reliable sources of evidence  and they defer to unreliable. This deference,  which may be explicit or implicit, is itself  rational on both sides. Given that we’re epis - temically social animals, it’s largely through  deference that we come to know about the  world and generate further knowledge.” 78 O’Madagain and Tomasello 2022; Tomasello  2018, 2020. 79 Levy 2021; Schmelz and Bowles 2022; Sco - ville and others 2022. 80 Kahan and others 2017a; Schaffner and Luks  2018. 81 Henrich and others 2022, p. 13. 82 For an example of models contrasting po - litical choice based on interests versus ideas  (based on identity or world views), see Ash,  Mukand and Rodrik (2021). 83 We are grateful to Benjamin Enke of Harvard  University for this suggestion through direct  communication. 84 “If we want to effectively reduce political  polarization, we need to recognize the biases  that our brains impose in processing and the ways that broader institutions (e.g., media and  political systems) may shape our thoughts and  feelings. […] Only once we realize that we are  all subject to many layers of influence that our  brains seamlessly convince constitute ‘reality’  will we then be able to successfully reduce  political polarization” (Moore-Berg and others  2020, p. 28553). 85 See, for instance, Sharot and Sunstein (2020).  Box-Steffensmeier and others (2022) provide  a review of emerging findings and directions  for future research on the understanding of  human behaviour. 86 As Sen (2009a, p.  288) wrote: “Once the  priority of a social affiliation (chosen or un - chosen) is accepted as an integral part of  one’s ‘overall identity,’ something substantial  is lost. This includes the ability to recognize  easily that one has to decide on one’s social  affiliations, which does not compromise one’s  personal identity.” 87 Henrich and others (2022) review evidence  of how many cognitive biases vary across  societies, with some disappearing or revers - ing, including overconfidence, risk aversion,  the gambler’s fallacy, the hot hand fallacy,  the representative heuristic, neglecting re - gression to the mean, functional fixity and  the endowment effect. A more nuanced  view is that some features are universal, but  their manifestations vary across cultures. For  instance, hyperbolic discounting (discounting  the immediate future more than the far future)  was shown to be present in 53 countries  but with great heterogeneity for shorter time  horizons across countries (Wang, Rieger and  Hens 2016). They also appear to vary across  people depending on measures of analytical  sophistication and education level (Frederick  2005). 88 Even if there are differing views on what is  and is not universal, see Cosmides and Tooby  (2013), Cosmides, Barrett and Tooby (2010)  and Pinker (2010). For an evolutionary ac - count of the origins of hyperbolic discounting  (not limited to humans), see Dasgupta and  Maskin (2005). Often psychological evolu - tionary arguments are based on time-shifted  rationality theories, which explain what is now  described as a cognitive bias that deviates  from rational choice as resulting from the  persistence of cognition traits that evolved  to adapt to environments in the evolutionary  past. For instance, Jaeger and others (2020)  present evidence that links the magnitude  of the endowment effect to evolutionary sa - lience of different items. 89 Henrich 2020. The type of norm in question,  whether it is injunctive (prescribing behaviour)  or descriptive (where people follow how  others behaviour), also matters on the type  of emotion that has greater salience (Elster  2015). 90 Frank 1988. 91 Almås and others 2022; Falk and others 2018;  Huppert and others 2019. 92 To use the expression of Hoff and Stiglitz  (2016).

Key contributions to this  understanding of culture include DiMaggio  1997, Patterson 2014 and Swidler 1986. An  early account of culture consistent with this  perspective comes from Geertz (1973). See  also Amenta and Polletta (2019) and Bonn  (2015). That a person’s sense of self has  behavioural implications is recognized in  economic models of identity such as those  by Akerlof and Kranton (2000), but those  models do not specify where identity comes  from, as recognized and explored in Huettel  and Kranton (2012) and Kranton and others  (2020). This perspective from sociology offers  an answer to the question of where a sense  of self comes about and how. 95 Schilbach, Schofield and Mullainathan 2016;  Schofield and Venkataramani 2021. 96 See Lamont and others (2017) for an explo - ration of the implications of this perspective  on these studies. Indeed, Lambe and others  (2020) show that development interventions  that build their understanding of behaviour  change as contextual, taking place in relation  to complex socioecological systems that also  evolve over time, are more successful in cre - ating robust and long-lasting change. 97 Sanchez, Lamont and Zilberstein 2022. 98 This includes Acemoglu (2022), Acemo - glu and Robinson (2021, 2022), Acemoglu,  Egorov and Sonin (2020) and Lowes and oth - ers (2017). 99 Richerson, Gavrilets and de Waal (2021)  provide a recent statement of the achieve - ments and potential contributions of this  perspective. 100 For an illustration of critiques and responses,  see, for instance, Henrich and others (2016)  and Richerson and others (2016).

Sometimes observed behaviour by  WEIRD people deviates from the rational  choice model—thus, described as some of  the biases discussed above—in other cases  behaviour consistent with rational choice is  observed in non-WEIRD populations (Api - cella, Norenzayan and Henrich 2020; Henrich  2020; Henrich, Heine and Norenzayan 2010a,  2010b; Muthukrishna and others 2020). 103 Falk and others 2018. 104 Henrich and others 2022, p.  3. Culture  develops and is transmitted through social  learning and affects not only how people  solve specific problems but also how they  conceptualize the world and think of their  selves. Culture shapes “core aspects of  our attention, perception, thought, memory,  reasoning, motivations, mentalizing abilities, decision heuristics/biases or moral intuitions,  […and] what constitutes a good argument or  solid evidence” (Henrich and others 2022,  p. 1). Boyd, Richerson and Henrich 2011. 105 Gelfand and others 2011; Jackson, Gelfand  and Ember 2020. 106 Gelfand and Jackson 2016. 107 Morris, Chiu and Liu 2015; Vignoles and oth - ers 2016. The huge variation in beliefs and  values occurs even within a shared cultural  setting. In fact, a set of cultural attributes and  the psychological traits associated with it do  not have a one-to-one counterpart at the indi - vidual level (Na and others 2010). That is, just  because one society can be associated with  a cultural and psychological package charac - terized by, say, more individualistic traits and  another society can be characterized by more  interdependent psychological traits does not  mean that everyone in the first society is indi - vidualistic and everyone in the second is not.  For instance, Markus (2016) and Markus and  Kitayama (1991) have shown that the United  States is a more individualistic culture valu - ing independence than Japan but that within  the United States. However, Grusky, Hall and  Markus (2019) found that some disadvan - taged groups in the United States behave  in a way and have an understanding of the  self that values interdependence more than  independence. Lamont (2000) shows how  different racial and socioeconomic groups in  different countries construct different frames  of how they live dignified lives, in cultural con - texts that are dominated by individualistic and  materialistic pursuits are culturally dominant  signifiers of value. 108 Henrich and others 2016; Kwon, Wormley and  Varnum 2021; Varnum and Grossmann 2021. 109 Henrich and Muthukrishna 2021; Muthukrish - na, Henrich and Slingerland 2021. 110 Enke 2019. 111 Nunn (2022), which provides the basis for the  discussion in this paragraph. 112 Buggle and Durante 2021; Giuliano and Nunn  2020. 113 Sen 1997b, p. 749. 114 Buchanan 2020. 115 Raymond, Kelly and Hennes 2021; Raymond  and others 2014. 116 Hauser and others 2014. 117 Gross and Böhm 2020; Gross and Dreu 2019;  Gross and others 2020. 118 Barrett and Dannenberg 2012; Dannenberg  and Barrett 2018. 119 Particularly the WEIRD package, perhaps a  reason for why it is emulated in many differ - ent contexts, as argued in Henrich (2020).  For instance, Santos, Varnum and Grossmann  (2017) document increases in individualist  practices and values across 78 countries over  the past 50 years or so. 120 Thompson 2021. 121 Lübke 2021, p. 153. 122 Eom and others 2016.123 Lu, Jin and English 2021. 124 We are thankful for Ravi Kanbur’s suggestion  of using the “3 I’s” framework. Institutions  can be formal—government structures, laws  and regulations—or informal—social norms,  habits and customs—and they are gener - ally understood as “rules” or constraints that  guide behaviour and give meaning to social  life (Breukers and Wolsink, 2007; Hall 1997;  North 1990; Scott 2008). Interests can be un - derstood as the agendas of different groups  or the preferences and power embedded in  policy actors. Ideas refer to the knowledge  and values held by actors regarding what or  how things are and ought to be (Pomey and  others 2010; Shearer and others 2016). 125 Ash, Mukand and Rodrik 2021. 126 Akerlof 2020; Akerlof and Snower 2016;  Meckling and Allan 2020; Shiller 2017. 127 Mokyr 2013, 2016. For instance, creating  a culture of innovation drew from cultural  entrepreneurs such as Francis Bacon and  Isaac Newton, who created focal points  around which people could coordinate new  beliefs—focal points in game theory enable  people to coordinate their actions without  the need for cooperation. For a related, also  culture-based, but slightly different argument,  see also Mokyr (2013). 128 Schill and others 2019, p 1075. 129 For models of development that can follow  different paths—more or less “green”—de - pending on “ideas,” broadly defined, see  Besley and Persson (2020, 2021) and Persson  and Tabellini (2020). 130 Schimmelpfennig and others 2022. 131 Hauser and Norton 2017. 132 UNDP 2022b. 133 Pinto and others 2022; UNDP 2022b. 134 UNDP 2019. 135 UNDP 2020a. 136 Polasky and others 2020. 137 Hacker 2018c. 138 Hogg 2021. 139 Sandel 2020. 140 Funke, Schularick and Trebesch 2016. 141 See, for example, Makridis and Rothwell  (2020) on how polarization and partisanship  influenced the effectiveness of public health  policies and Bruine de Bruin, Saw and Gold - man (2020) on how political preferences  determined risk perceptions and willingness  to follow public health mandates in the United  States during the pandemic. 142 Levy 2022. 143 Bordalo, Gennaioli and Shleifer 2012, 2021. 144 Similarly, recognizing that evolutionary  processes may play a role in the changes  of behaviour and institutions is important to  understand cultural variation and change but  does not mean that purposeful reasoning is  abandoned as we wait for selection to do its  work. We may not have enough time to wait  NOTES 225 for relevant evolutionary processes to play  out. Here, again, we have to think ahead. 145 To use the expression of Sen (2009b) when  discussing how beliefs created under spe - cific “positional features” form and are hard  to change. The example given by Sen is that  of someone in a position who does not have  knowledge of distance-dependent projec - tions and no other information about the sun  and the moon as seen from Earth and con - cludes that they are of the same size (as they  appear to be when observed from Earth). 146 Lees 2022. 147 Mernyk and others 2022. 148 Fernbach and Van Boven 2022. 149 Fernbach and Van Boven 2022. See also, for  example, experimental evidence by Bursztyn,  González and Yanagizawa-Drott (2018), who  show that men in Saudi Arabia tend to under - estimate the support for female labour force  participation among their neighbours and that  revealing information about the actual level  of support tends to shift attitudes in favour of  women working outside the home. 150 Muthukrishna and Henrich 2016. 151 Indeed, part of the deteriorating support for  democratic processes noted in chapter 1 may  be found in perceptions of a system that is  unfair and rigged, stacked against the aver - age person, where those process fail to ef - fectively channel different voices and deliver  on concerns. Pinto and others (2022) note  declining attitudes towards democracy along - side increased perceptions of corruption  and government inefficiency. UNDP (2021b)  shows how the stark concentration of power  in Latin America seems to translate into a high  share of people believing that their countries  are run in the interest of the few, rather than in  the interest of the citizens. 152 We are grateful to Belinda Reyers for sug - gesting that it is useful to understand what  shapes people’s behaviour and the multiple  processes through with behavioural change  and institutional reform interact and appreci - ate the inherent uncertainty associated with it.  But that is no reason to be resigned but rather  to think ahead, even acknowledging that  uncertainty will not be resolved. As argued in  chapter 1, what is required to ease planetary  pressures and to navigate uncertain futures  are transformative changes: we must go be - yond adapting to existing conditions, towards  strengthening capacities for transformations.  Specific capacities, such as learning and  reflexivity, engaging with complex dynamics  and diversity, navigating across scales and  responding to emergent processes, have  been found to be crucial (Moore and others  2018). Existing development practice has  highlighted capacities such as coordinated  decisionmaking, collective action and the  capacities to innovate and experiment and  is exploring the potential of transformative  capacities such as shift in attitudes towards  innovation and changes in cultural gender  norms, agency and leadership (Reyers and  others 2022). From a planetary perspective  the global biosphere and the diversity of life  on Earth form a critical aspect of capacities for transformative change. Biodiversity not  only mitigates, buffers and provides adaptive  capacities to respond to the turbulence and  uncertainty of the Anthropocene; it also rep - resents an undervalued and underexplored  source of options, innovation, capacities and  opportunities for human development in an  uncertain future. Moreover, transformative  change will ultimately depend on collective  capacities to see and analyse the whole  system, its social and ecological components,  their dynamics and especially capacities to  make visible and reimagine the interdepen - dencies that connect them (Moore and others  2018). 153 As argued in Cukier, Mayer-Schönberger and  de Véricourt (2022).

Data are weighted averages within countries,  with every country equally weighted. 8 Indeed, the Positive Peace Index developed  by the Institute for Economics and Peace  documents a decline in cooperative social  attitudes. This decline is linked to people’s di - minished tolerance for differing views, declin - ing trust in governments and reduced faith in  democratic institutions (Pinto and others 2022). 9 Perceived agency is lower for people facing  greater human insecurity than for people ex - periencing low human insecurity. Results are  statistically significant at the 1 percent level  for low and medium HDI and very high HDI  countries and territories. Results are statisti - cally significant at the 5 percent level for high  HDI countries and territories. 10 For instance, people who express low trust in  people with other religions are 10 percentage  points more likely to mention them as unde - sirable neighbours.

Results are statis - tically significant at the 1 percent level for all  income groups. 13 UNDP 2022b. 14 von Hippel and Fox 2021.15 The preference for extreme political positions  (left and right) is greater for people perceiving  very high human insecurity than for people  perceiving low human insecurity. Results are  statistically significant at the 1 percent level. 16 The preferences for extreme views on  government responsibility and individual  responsibility are significantly greater for  people perceiving very high insecurity than  for people perceiving low human insecurity.  Results are statistically significant at the 1 per - cent level. 17 As part of this debate, the design of social  insurance policies has been greatly affected  by the characterization of moral hazard in the  economics literature: in the presence of asym - metric information, protecting people against  risks might increase risk-taking behaviour.  At least in the United States, this has been a  contributing factor to a shift in the distribution  of risks, increasing people’s exposure to dif - ferent types of shocks.

Mature  technology has reached sizeable deploy - ment, and only incremental innovations are  expected. Early adoption technology means  that some designs have reached markets and  policy support is required for scale-up. But  there are competing designs being validated  at the demonstration and prototype phases.  Offshore power, wind power, electric batter - ies and heat pumps are examples. Examples  of demonstration designs are carbon capture  in cement kilns, electrolytic hydrogen-based  ammonia and methanol, and large long- distance battery-electric ships. Prototype  designs are at prototype stage of a certain  scale. Ammonia-powered vessels, electrolytic  hydrogen-based steel production and direct  air capture are examples of large prototypes.  Battery-electric aircraft and direct electrifica - tion of primary steelmaking are examples  of small prototypes. Technologies at the  concept stage have just been formulated but  need to be validated. Lithium-air batteries  and electrifying a steam cracker for olefins  production are examples. 50 Brynjolfsson 2022. 51 As discussed in the 2019 Human Develop - ment Report (UNDP 2019). 52 Dean 2022. 53 Dean 2022. 54 Callaway and others 2022. 55 Brynjolfsson 2022. 56 Furman and Seamans 2018. 57 Alonso and others 2020; Furman and Sea - mans 2018. 58 See Frank and others (2019) and Genz (2022). 59 Brynjolfsson 2022; Malone, Rus and Lau - bacher 2020. 60 Acemoglu and Restrepo 2019; Autor, Salo - mons and Seegmiller 2021.  61 Autor, Salomons and Seegmiller 2021. 62 Preston 2018. 63 Meng and Ellis 2020; National Academy of  Engineering and Council 2013.64 June and others 2018. 65 Collins and Curiel 2021; Katz and others 2018. 66 Trosset and Carbonell 2015. 67 Rogers and Oldroyd 2014; Wurtzel and others  2019. 68 Lorenzo and others 2018. 69 Redford and others 2014. 70 The Royal Society 2019; Schmidt 2010. 71 Evans 2021. 72 Acemoglu and Restrepo 2020; Eeckhout  2021; Korinek and Stiglitz 2021. 73 The threats associated with the proliferation  of digital technologies are also covered in  depth in UNDP (2022b). 74 Funtowicz and Ravetz 1993. 75 Khushf 2006. 76 Jasanoff and Hurlbut 2018; Scheufele and  others 2021; Yu, Xue and Barrangou 2021. 77 Basu, Caspi and Hockett 2021. 78 See box 1.1 in UNDP (2022b).

In this context com - munity resilience can be understood as the  existence, development and engagement of  community resources by community mem - bers to thrive in an environment characterized  by change, uncertainty, unpredictability and  surprise.  11 Results from a cross-sectional and longitu - dinal research case study reveal that com - munity organizing elevates psychological  empowerment and civic engagement over  time (Speer, Christens and Peterson 2021). 12 Miranda and Snower 2022. 13 UNDP 2015. 14 UNDP 2022b. 15 Florini, LaForge and Sharma 2022. 16 Okonjo-Iweala, Shanmugaratnam and Sum - mers 2021. 17 Okonjo-Iweala, Shanmugaratnam and Sum - mers 2021. 18 IMF 2021b. 19 IMF 2021b. 20 Such arrangements depend in practice on  the efficacy of processes for making and  implementing major decisions throughout  society—in a word, governance (Florini, La - Forge and Sharma 2022). Governance is the  process through which state and nonstate  actors interact to design and implement poli - cies within a given set of formal and informal  rules that shape and are shaped by power  (World Bank 2017b). There are many impedi - ments to governance, from the distortion of  information by powerful economic interests  that diluted support to policies ranging from  tobacco consumption control to climate  change mitigation (as reviewed in chapter 3)  to corruption. Empirical evidence shows that  corruption and poor governance correlate  228 HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2021/2022 with lower economic growth, investment and  tax revenue (Cerra and others 2021). And  governments that are captured by vested in - terests are liable to hinder societally needed  changes rather than bring them about (Stein - berger 2018). 21 Florini, LaForge and Sharma 2022. 22 Snower 2020. 23 Mach and Field 2017. 24 Florini, LaForge and Sharma 2022. 25 Fuentes-Nieva 2022. 26 Supporting the practices of indigenous  peoples that sustain biodiversity is key, es - pecially since lands managed by indigenous  peoples—around 25 percent of global land  area—host an estimated 80 percent of global  biodiversity (UNDP 2020a). 27 UNDP 2020a. 28 McGregor 2009; Whyte 2013. 29 McCrea, Walton and Leonard 2014. 30 Fishback 2022. 31 This paragraph is based on Fishback (2022). 32 Upper 2017. 33 Zurbrügg 2022. 34 Edwards 2021; Upper 2017; Zurbrügg 2022. 35 IMF 2017. 36 IMF 2017. 37 Cicchiello and others 2021; Huambachano  2018. 38 Demirguc-Kunt and others 2022. 39 Kasman, Heuberger and Hammond 2018. 40 Hanna and Olken 2018; Ravallion 2017. 41 Molina and Ortiz-Juarez 2020; Yang and oth - ers 2016. 42 Ruckert, Huynh and Labonté 2018. 43 Hanna and Olken 2018. 44 Korinek and Stiglitz 2021. 45 Coote and Percy 2020; Gough 2021. 46 UNDP 2022b. 47 Gough 2019. 48 Dein 2020; Igreja, Kleijn and Richters 2006;  Kpobi and Swartz 2019.

According to that report,  “now is the time to renew the social contract  between governments and their people and  within societies” (p. 4). Mechanisms to rebuild trust and embrace a comprehensive vision  of human rights also include updated gover - nance arrangements to deliver better public  goods, health coverage, education, skills,  decent work and housing, as well as universal  access to the internet by 2030 as a basic hu - man right. 53 Mach and Field 2017; OHCHR and the Hein - rich Böll Foundation 2018. 54 OHCHR 2019. 55 The Centre for Human Rights Education in  Lahore, Pakistan, has created spaces for de - bate on the relevance of religious tolerance  and respect.
